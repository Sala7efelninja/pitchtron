/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0050.wav|His attachment to Marxist and Communist doctrine was probably, in some measure, an expression of his hostility to his environment.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0052.wav|that his commitment to Marxism was an important factor influencing his conduct during his adult years.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0053.wav|It was an obvious element in his decision to go to Russia and later to Cuba and it probably influenced his decision to shoot at General Walker.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0054.wav|It was a factor which contributed to his character and thereby might have influenced his decision to assassinate President Kennedy.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0063.wav|Significant in shaping the character of Lee Harvey Oswald was the death of his father, a collector of insurance premiums.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0064.wav|This occurred 2 months before Lee was born in New Orleans on October 18, 1939.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0065.wav|That death strained the financial fortunes of the remainder of the Oswald family.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0066.wav|It had its effect on Lee's mother, Marguerite, his brother Robert, who had been born in 1934,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0067.wav|and his half-brother John Pic, who had been born in 1932 during Marguerite's previous marriage.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0068.wav|It forced Marguerite Oswald to go to work to provide for her family.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0069.wav|Reminding her sons that they were orphans and that the family's financial condition was poor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0070.wav|she placed John Pic and Robert Oswald in an orphans' home.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0071.wav|From the time Marguerite Oswald returned to work until December 26, 1942, when Lee too was sent to the orphans' home,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0072.wav|he was cared for principally by his mother's sister, by babysitters and by his mother, when she had time for him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0073.wav|Marguerite Oswald withdrew Lee from the orphans' home and took him with her to Dallas when he was a little over 4 years old.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0074.wav|About 6 months later she also withdrew John Pic and Robert Oswald.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0075.wav|Apparently that action was taken in anticipation of her marriage to Edwin A. Ekdahl, which took place in May of 1945.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0076.wav|In the fall of that year John Pic and Robert Oswald went to a military academy|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0077.wav|where they stayed, except for vacations, until the spring of 1948.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0078.wav|Lee Oswald remained with his mother and Ekdahl, to whom he became quite attached.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0079.wav|John Pic testified that he thought Lee found in Ekdahl the father that he never had.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0080.wav|That situation, however, was short-lived,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0081.wav|for the relations between Marguerite Oswald and Ekdahl were stormy and they were finally divorced, after several separations and reunions,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0082.wav|in the summer of 1948.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0083.wav|After the divorce Mrs. Oswald complained considerably about how unfairly she was treated,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0084.wav|dwelling on the fact that she was a widow with three children.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0086.wav|In the fall of 1948 she told John Pic and Robert Oswald|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0087.wav|that she could not afford to send them back to the military school and she asked Pic to quit school entirely to help support the family.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0088.wav|which he did for 4 months in the fall of 1948.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0089.wav|In order to supplement their income further she falsely swore that Pic was 17 years old so that he could join the Marine Corps Reserves.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0090.wav|Pic did turn over part of his income to his mother,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0091.wav|but he returned to high school in January of 1949, where he stayed until 3 days before he was scheduled to graduate,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0092.wav|when he left school in order to get into the Coast Guard. Since his mother did not approve of his decision to continue school|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0093.wav|he accepted the responsibility for that decision himself and signed his mother's name to all his own excuses and report cards.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0094.wav|Pic thought that his mother overstated her financial problems and was unduly concerned about money.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0095.wav|Referring to the period after the divorce from Ekdahl, which was apparently caused in part by Marguerite's desire to get more money from him,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0096.wav|Pic said, quote,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0100.wav|she would sometimes take Lee with her, apparently leaving him alone in the car while she transacted her business.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0101.wav|When she worked during the school year, Lee had to leave an empty house in the morning,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0102.wav|return to it for lunch and then again at night, his mother having trained him to do that rather than to play with other children.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0103.wav|An indication of the nature of Lee's character at this time was provided in the spring of 1950,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0104.wav|when he was sent to New Orleans to visit the family of his mother's sister, Mrs. Lillian Murret, for 2 or 3 weeks.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0106.wav|It also appears that Lee tried to tag along with his older brothers|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ040-0108.wav|which became more significant as the children grew older.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0004.wav|Defection to the Soviet Union|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0005.wav|After Oswald left the Marine Corps in September of 1959, ostensibly to care for his mother,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0006.wav|he almost immediately left for the Soviet Union where he attempted to renounce his citizenship.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0007.wav|At the age of 19, Oswald thus committed an act which was the most striking indication he had yet given|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0008.wav|of his willingness to act on his beliefs in quite extraordinary ways.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0009.wav|While his defection resulted in part from Oswald's commitment to Marxism,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0010.wav|it appears that personal and psychological factors were also involved.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0011.wav|On August 17, 1963, Oswald told Mr. William Stuckey,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0012.wav|who had arranged a radio debate on Oswald's activities on behalf of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0013.wav|that while he had begun to read Marx and Engels at the age of 15, the conclusive thing that made him decide that Marxism was the answer|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0014.wav|was his service in Japan.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0015.wav|He said living conditions over there convinced him something was wrong with the system, and that possibly Marxism was the answer.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0016.wav|He said it was in Japan that he made up his mind to go to Russia|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0017.wav|and see for himself how a revolutionary society operates, a Marxist society.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0018.wav|On the other hand, at least one person who knew Oswald after his return thought that his defection had a more personal and psychological basis.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0019.wav|The validity of the latter observation is borne out by some of the things Oswald wrote in connection with his defection|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0020.wav|indicating that his motivation was at least in part a personal one. On November 26, 1959,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0021.wav|shortly after he arrived in the Soviet Union, and probably before Soviet authorities had given him permission to stay indefinitely,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0022.wav|he wrote to his brother Robert that the Soviet Union was a country which, quote, I have always considered to be my own, end quote,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0030.wav|it would have taken considerable discipline to save whatever amount was required to finance his defection out of the salary of a low ranking enlisted man.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0032.wav|and of his initial commitment to that country can best be understood, however, in the context|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ042-0033.wav|of his concomitant hatred of the United States, which was most clearly expressed in his November 26,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ043-0013.wav|Part of the problem resulted from the fact that, as Jeanne De Mohrenschildt testified,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ043-0099.wav|It appears that his discharge was hastened by the fact that he brought a Russian language newspaper to work.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ047-0125.wav|In other words, he committed no violation of the law by telling us something that wasn't true, and unless this required further investigation at that time,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ047-0169.wav|Hosty took the necessary steps to have the Dallas office of the FBI, rather than the New Orleans office, reestablished as the office with principal responsibility.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ047-0170.wav|On November 5, Hosty was traveling near Mrs. Paine's home and took the occasion to stop by to ask whether she had any further information.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ047-0171.wav|Mrs. Paine had nothing to add to what she had already told him, except that during a visit that past weekend,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ047-0181.wav|and realized immediately that Oswald had given false biographic information. Hosty knew that he would eventually have to investigate this, and, quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ047-0182.wav|was quite interested in determining the nature of his contact with the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, end quote.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ047-0185.wav|I had now established that Lee Oswald was not employed in a sensitive industry.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ047-0186.wav|I can now afford to wait until New Orleans forwarded the necessary papers to me to show me I now had all the information.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ047-0189.wav|Answer: No. I would have to wait until I had talked to Marina to see what I could determine, and from there I could make my plans.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0022.wav|Answer: Yes. It was a self-serving interview. The visits with the Soviet Embassy were evidently for the purpose of securing a visa,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0026.wav|He gave evidence of settling down.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0035.wav|It was against this background and consistent with the criteria followed by the FBI prior to November 22|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0048.wav|All this does seem to amount to enough to have induced an alert agency, such as the FBI,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0049.wav|possessed of this information to list Oswald as a potential threat to the safety of the President.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0052.wav|and less narrow interpretation of their responsibilities.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0053.wav|It is the conclusion of the Commission that, even in the absence of Secret Service criteria|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0055.wav|a more alert and carefully considered treatment of the Oswald case by the Bureau might have brought about such a referral.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0265.wav|after which time a very moderate use of liquor will not be considered a violation. However, all members of the White House Detail|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0274.wav|However, he felt that any disciplinary action might have given rise|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0278.wav|The Commission recognizes that the responsibilities of members of the White House detail of the Secret Service are arduous.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0280.wav|It might seem harsh to circumscribe their opportunities for relaxation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0281.wav|Yet their role of protecting the President is so important to the well-being of the country|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0282.wav|that it is reasonable to expect them to meet very high standards of personal conduct,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0283.wav|so that nothing can interfere with their bringing to their task the finest qualities and maximum resources of mind and body.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ048-0284.wav|This is the salutary goal to which the Secret Service regulation is directed,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0168.wav|As discussed above, the Bureau has attempted to meet its responsibilities in this field by spelling out in its Handbook|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0173.wav|As the testimony of J. Edgar Hoover and other Bureau officials revealed, the FBI did not believe that its directive required the Bureau|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0174.wav|to notify the Secret Service of the substantial information about Lee Harvey Oswald which the FBI had accumulated|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0176.wav|On the other hand, the Secret Service had no knowledge whatever of Oswald, his background, or his employment at the Book Depository,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0177.wav|and Robert I. Bouck, who was in charge of the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service, believed that the accumulation of the facts known to the FBI|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0178.wav|should have constituted a sufficient basis to warn the Secret Service of the Oswald risk.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0179.wav|The Commission believes that both the FBI and the Secret Service have too narrowly construed their respective responsibilities.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0180.wav|The Commission has the impression|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0181.wav|that too much emphasis is placed by both on the investigation of specific threats by individuals and not enough on dangers from other sources.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0182.wav|In addition, the Commission has concluded that the Secret Service particularly tends to be the passive recipient of information|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0183.wav|regarding such threats and that its Protective Research Section is not adequately staffed or equipped|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0185.wav|During the period the Commission was giving thought to this situation,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0186.wav|the Commission received a number of proposals designed to improve current arrangements for protecting the President.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0187.wav|These proposals included suggestions to locate exclusive responsibility for all phases of the work|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0188.wav|in one or another Government agency, to clarify the division of authority between the agencies involved, and to retain the existing system|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0189.wav|but expand both the scope and the operations of the existing agencies, particularly those of the Secret Service and the FBI.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0190.wav|It has been pointed out that the FBI, as our chief investigative agency,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0191.wav|is properly manned and equipped to carry on extensive information gathering functions within the United States.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0192.wav|It was also suggested that it would take a substantial period of time for the Secret Service to build up the experience and skills necessary to meet the problem.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0193.wav|Consequently the suggestion has been made, on the one hand, that all preventive investigative functions relating to the security of the President|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0194.wav|should be transferred to the FBI,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0195.wav|leaving with the Secret Service only the responsibility for the physical protection of the President, that is, the guarding function alone.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0196.wav|On the other hand, it is urged that all features of the protection of the President and his family should be committed to an elite and independent corps.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0197.wav|It is also contended that the agents should be intimately associated with the life of the Presidential family|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0198.wav|in all its ramifications and alert to every danger that might befall it,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0199.wav|and ready at any instant to hazard great danger to themselves in the performance of their tremendous responsibility.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0200.wav|It is suggested that an organization shorn of its power to investigate all the possibilities of danger to the President|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0201.wav|and becoming merely the recipient of information gathered by others would become limited solely to acts of physical alertness and personal courage|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0202.wav|incident to its responsibilities.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0203.wav|So circumscribed, it could not maintain the esprit de corps or the necessary alertness for this unique and challenging responsibility.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0204.wav|While in accordance with its mandate|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0205.wav|this Commission has necessarily examined into the functioning of the various Federal agencies concerned with the tragic trip of President Kennedy to Dallas|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0206.wav|and while it has arrived at certain conclusions in respect thereto, it seems clear|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0207.wav|that it was not within the Commission's responsibility to make specific recommendations as to the long-range organization of the President's protection,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0208.wav|except as conclusions flowing directly from its examination of the President's assassination can be drawn.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0209.wav|The Commission was not asked to apply itself as did the Hoover Commission in 1949,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0210.wav|for examples to a determination of the optimum organization of the President's protection.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0211.wav|It would have been necessary for the Commission to take considerable testimony, much of it extraneous to the facts of the assassination of President Kennedy,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0212.wav|to put it in a position to reach final conclusions in this respect.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0213.wav|There are always dangers of divided responsibility,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0214.wav|duplication, and confusion of authority where more than one agency is operating in the same field; but on the other hand|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0215.wav|the protection of the President is in a real sense a Government-wide responsibility which must necessarily assumed by the Department of State,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0217.wav|Moreover, a number of imponderable questions have to be weighed if any change in the intimate association now established|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0218.wav|between the Secret Service and the President and his family is contemplated.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0219.wav|These considerations have induced the Commission to believe|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0220.wav|that the determination of whether or not there should be a relocation of responsibilities and functions should be left to the Executive and the Congress,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0221.wav|perhaps upon recommendations based on further studies by the Cabinet-level committee recommended above or the National Security Council.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0222.wav|Pending any such determination, however, this Commission is convinced of the necessity of better coordination|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ049-0223.wav|and direction of the activities of all existing agencies of Government which are in a position to and do, furnish information|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0056.wav|On December 26, 1963, the FBI circulated additional instructions to all its agents,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0066.wav|The volume of references to the Secret Service has increased substantially since the new instructions went into effect;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0067.wav|more than 5,000 names were referred to the Secret Service in the first 4 months of 1964.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0068.wav|According to Chief Rowley, by mid-June 1964,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0069.wav|the Secret Service had received from the FBI some 9,000 reports on members of the Communist Party.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0072.wav|that referrals to the Secret Service under the new criteria might, if not properly handled,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0074.wav|They emphasized the necessity that the information now being furnished be handled with judgment and care.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0075.wav|The Commission shares this concern.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0076.wav|The problem is aggravated by the necessity that the Service obtain the assistance of local law enforcement officials in evaluating the information which it receives|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0077.wav|and in taking preventive steps.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0078.wav|In June 1964, the Secret Service sent to a number of Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0079.wav|guidelines for an experimental program to develop more detailed criteria.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0081.wav|The new tentative criteria are useful in making clear that|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0082.wav|the interest of the Secret Service goes beyond information on individuals or groups threatening to cause harm or embarrassment to the President.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0083.wav|Information is requested also concerning individuals or groups who have demonstrated an interest in the President|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0084.wav|or, quote, other high government officials in the nature of a complaint coupled with an expressed or implied determination to use a means,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0086.wav|Under these criteria, whether the case should be referred to the Secret Service depends on the existence of a previous history of mental instability,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0087.wav|propensity toward violent action, or some similar characteristic, coupled with some evaluation of the capability of the individual or group|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0088.wav|to further the intention to satisfy a grievance by unlawful means.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0089.wav|While these tentative criteria are a step in the right direction,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0090.wav|they seem unduly restrictive in continuing to require some manifestation of animus against a Government official.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0091.wav|It is questionable whether such criteria would have resulted in the referral of Oswald to the Secret Service.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0092.wav|Chief Rowley believed that they would,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0093.wav|because of Oswald's demonstrated hostility toward the Secretary of the Navy in his letter of January 30, 1962. Quote,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0095.wav|The U.S. government has no charges or complaints against me.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0097.wav|Even with the advantage of hindsight, this letter does not appear to express or imply Oswald's, quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0098.wav|determination to use a means, other than legal or peaceful, to satisfy his grievance, end quote, within the meaning of the new criteria.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0099.wav|It is apparent that a good deal of further consideration and experimentation will be required before adequate criteria can be framed.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0104.wav|Each of them was a failure in his work and in his relations with others, a victim of delusions and fancies which led to the conviction|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0109.wav|Since the assassination, the Service has recognized that these relationships must be far more formal|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0111.wav|Once the Secret Service has formulated its new standards for collection of information, it should enter into written agreements with each Federal agency|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0112.wav|and the leading State and local agencies that might be a source of such information.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0113.wav|Such agreements should describe in detail the information which is sought, the manner in which it will be provided to the Secret Service,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0115.wav|This is especially necessary with regard to the FBI and CIA,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0118.wav|Since these agencies are already obliged constantly to evaluate the activities of such groups,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0119.wav|they should be responsible for advising the Secret Service if information develops indicating the existence of an assassination plot|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0120.wav|and for reporting such events as a change in leadership or dogma which indicate that the group may present a danger to the President.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0121.wav|Detailed formal agreements embodying these arrangements should be worked out between the Secret Service and both of these agencies.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0122.wav|It should be made clear that the Secret Service will in no way seek to duplicate the intelligence|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0125.wav|Once experience has been gained in implementing such agreements with the Federal and leading State and local agencies,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0130.wav|Finally, these agreements with Federal and local authorities will be of little value|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0159.wav|The Commission recommends that prompt and favorable consideration be given to this request.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0160.wav|The Commission further recommends that the Secret Service coordinate its planning as closely as possible with all of the Federal agencies from which it receives information.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0163.wav|the Secret Service should attempt to develop a system compatible with those of the agencies from which most of its data will come. Note:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0164.wav|In evaluating data processing techniques of the Secret Service,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0166.wav|The Commission was struck by the apparent lack of effort, on an interagency basis,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0167.wav|to develop coordinated and mutually compatible systems, even where such coordination would not seem inconsistent|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0168.wav|with the particular purposes of the agency involved. The Commission recognizes that this is a controversial area|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0169.wav|and that many strongly held views are advanced in resistance to any suggestion that an effort be made to impose any degree of coordination.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0172.wav|The Commission, therefore, recommends that the President consider ordering an inquiry into the possibility|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0179.wav|Based on its experience during this period, the Secret Service now recommends that additional personnel be made available to PRS|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0187.wav|Thus, the local chief of police could be given a master plan, prepared for the occasion, of all protective measures to be taken during the visit;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0211.wav|Chief Rowley testified that the present workload of each Secret Service agent averages 110.1 cases.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0212.wav|While these statistics relate to the activities of Secret Service agents stationed in field offices and not the White House detail,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0218.wav|Chief Rowley explained that this would not provide enough additional manpower to take all the measures which he considers required.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0223.wav|The plan provides for an additional 205 agents for the Secret Service. Seventeen of this number are proposed for the Protective Research Section;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/xxx/wav_trimmed_22050/LJ050-0236.wav|Thus, in the 4 months following the assassination,|xxx|1
