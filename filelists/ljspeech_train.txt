/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0002.wav|in being comparatively modern.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0003.wav|For although the Chinese took impressions from wood blocks engraved in relief for centuries before the woodcutters of the Netherlands, by a similar process|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0005.wav|the invention of movable metal letters in the middle of the fifteenth century may justly be considered as the invention of the art of printing.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0006.wav|And it is worth mention in passing that, as an example of fine typography,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0007.wav|"the earliest book printed with movable types, the Gutenberg, or ""forty-two line Bible"" of about 1455,"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0008.wav|has never been surpassed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0009.wav|Printing, then, for our purpose, may be considered as the art of making books by means of movable types.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0010.wav|Now, as all books not primarily intended as picture-books consist principally of types composed to form letterpress,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0011.wav|it is of the first importance that the letter used should be fine in form;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0012.wav|especially as no more time is occupied, or cost incurred, in casting, setting, or printing beautiful letters|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0013.wav|than in the same operations with ugly ones.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0014.wav|And it was a matter of course that in the Middle Ages, when the craftsmen took care that beautiful form should always be a part of their productions whatever they were,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0015.wav|the forms of printed letters should be beautiful, and that their arrangement on the page should be reasonable and a help to the shapeliness of the letters themselves.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0016.wav|The Middle Ages brought calligraphy to perfection, and it was natural therefore|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0017.wav|that the forms of printed letters should follow more or less closely those of the written character, and they followed them very closely.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0018.wav|The first books were printed in black letter, i.e. the letter which was a Gothic development of the ancient Roman character,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0026.wav|On the whole the type of this book may be considered the ne-plus-ultra of Gothic type,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0027.wav|especially as regards the lower-case letters; and type very similar was used during the next fifteen or twenty years not only by Schoeffer,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0028.wav|but by printers in Strasburg, Basle, Paris, Lubeck, and other cities.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0031.wav|In 1465 Sweynheim and Pannartz began printing in the monastery of Subiaco near Rome,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0032.wav|and used an exceedingly beautiful type, which is indeed to look at a transition between Gothic and Roman,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0033.wav|but which must certainly have come from the study of the twelfth or even the eleventh century MSS.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0035.wav|they discarded this for a more completely Roman and far less beautiful letter.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0036.wav|But about the same year Mentelin at Strasburg began to print in a type which is distinctly Roman;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0037.wav|and the next year Gunther Zeiner at Augsburg followed suit;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0038.wav|while in 1470 at Paris Udalric Gering and his associates turned out the first books printed in France, also in Roman character.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0039.wav|The Roman type of all these printers is similar in character,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0040.wav|and is very simple and legible, and unaffectedly designed for use; but it is by no means without beauty.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0041.wav|It must be said that it is in no way like the transition type of Subiaco,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0042.wav|and though more Roman than that, yet scarcely more like the complete Roman type of the earliest printers of Rome.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0043.wav|A further development of the Roman letter took place at Venice.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0044.wav|John of Spires and his brother Vindelin, followed by Nicholas Jenson, began to print in that city,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0045.wav|1469, 1470;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0046.wav|their type is on the lines of the German and French rather than of the Roman printers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0047.wav|Of Jenson it must be said that he carried the development of Roman type as far as it can go:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0048.wav|his letter is admirably clear and regular, but at least as beautiful as any other Roman type.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0049.wav|"After his death in the ""fourteen eighties,"" or at least by 1490, printing in Venice had declined very much;"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0050.wav|and though the famous family of Aldus restored its technical excellence, rejecting battered letters,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0051.wav|"and paying great attention to the ""press work"" or actual process of printing,"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0052.wav|yet their type is artistically on a much lower level than Jenson's, and in fact|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0053.wav|they must be considered to have ended the age of fine printing in Italy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0054.wav|Jenson, however, had many contemporaries who used beautiful type,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0055.wav|some of which -- as, e.g., that of Jacobus Rubeus or Jacques le Rouge -- is scarcely distinguishable from his.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0056.wav|It was these great Venetian printers, together with their brethren of Rome, Milan,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0057.wav|Parma, and one or two other cities, who produced the splendid editions of the Classics, which are one of the great glories of the printer's art,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0058.wav|and are worthy representatives of the eager enthusiasm for the revived learning of that epoch. By far,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0059.wav|the greater part of these Italian printers, it should be mentioned, were Germans or Frenchmen, working under the influence of Italian opinion and aims.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0060.wav|It must be understood that through the whole of the fifteenth and the first quarter of the sixteenth centuries|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0061.wav|the Roman letter was used side by side with the Gothic.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0062.wav|Even in Italy most of the theological and law books were printed in Gothic letter,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0063.wav|which was generally more formally Gothic than the printing of the German workmen,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0064.wav|many of whose types, indeed, like that of the Subiaco works, are of a transitional character.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0065.wav|This was notably the case with the early works printed at Ulm, and in a somewhat lesser degree at Augsburg.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0066.wav|In fact Gunther Zeiner's first type (afterwards used by Schussler) is remarkably like the type of the before-mentioned Subiaco books.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0067.wav|In the Low Countries and Cologne, which were very fertile of printed books, Gothic was the favorite.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0068.wav|The characteristic Dutch type, as represented by the excellent printer Gerard Leew, is very pronounced and uncompromising Gothic.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0069.wav|This type was introduced into England by Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton's successor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0070.wav|and was used there with very little variation all through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and indeed into the eighteenth.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0071.wav|Most of Caxton's own types are of an earlier character, though they also much resemble Flemish or Cologne letter.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0072.wav|After the end of the fifteenth century the degradation of printing, especially in Germany and Italy,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0073.wav|went on apace; and by the end of the sixteenth century there was no really beautiful printing done:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0074.wav|the best, mostly French or Low-Country, was neat and clear, but without any distinction;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0075.wav|the worst, which perhaps was the English, was a terrible falling-off from the work of the earlier presses;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0076.wav|and things got worse and worse through the whole of the seventeenth century, so that in the eighteenth printing was very miserably performed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0077.wav|In England about this time, an attempt was made (notably by Caslon, who started business in London as a type-founder in 1720)|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0078.wav|to improve the letter in form.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0079.wav|Caslon's type is clear and neat, and fairly well designed;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0080.wav|he seems to have taken the letter of the Elzevirs of the seventeenth century for his model:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0081.wav|type cast from his matrices is still in everyday use.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0082.wav|In spite, however, of his praiseworthy efforts, printing had still one last degradation to undergo.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0083.wav|The seventeenth century founts were bad rather negatively than positively.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0084.wav|But for the beauty of the earlier work they might have seemed tolerable.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0085.wav|It was reserved for the founders of the later eighteenth century to produce letters which are positively ugly, and which, it may be added,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0086.wav|are dazzling and unpleasant to the eye owing to the clumsy thickening and vulgar thinning of the lines:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0087.wav|for the seventeenth-century letters are at least pure and simple in line. The Italian, Bodoni, and the Frenchman, Didot,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0088.wav|were the leaders in this luckless change, though our own Baskerville, who was at work some years before them, went much on the same lines;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0089.wav|but his letters, though uninteresting and poor, are not nearly so gross and vulgar as those of either the Italian or the Frenchman.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0090.wav|With this change the art of printing touched bottom,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0091.wav|so far as fine printing is concerned, though paper did not get to its worst till about 1840.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0092.wav|The Chiswick press in 1844 revived Caslon's founts, printing for Messrs. Longman the Diary of Lady Willoughby.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0093.wav|This experiment was so far successful that about 1850 Messrs. Miller and Richard of Edinburgh|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0094.wav|"were induced to cut punches for a series of ""old style"" letters."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0095.wav|These and similar founts, cast by the above firm and others,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0096.wav|"have now come into general use and are obviously a great improvement on the ordinary ""modern style"" in use in England, which is in fact the Bodoni type"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0097.wav|"a little reduced in ugliness. The design of the letters of this modern ""old style"" leaves a good deal to be desired,"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0098.wav|and the whole effect is a little too gray, owing to the thinness of the letters.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0099.wav|It must be remembered, however, that most modern printing is done by machinery on soft paper, and not by the hand press,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0100.wav|and these somewhat wiry letters are suitable for the machine process, which would not do justice to letters of more generous design.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0101.wav|It is discouraging to note that the improvement of the last fifty years is almost wholly confined to Great Britain.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0102.wav|Here and there a book is printed in France or Germany with some pretension to good taste,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0103.wav|but the general revival of the old forms has made no way in those countries.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0104.wav|Italy is contentedly stagnant.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0105.wav|America has produced a good many showy books, the typography, paper, and illustrations of which are, however, all wrong,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0106.wav|oddity rather than rational beauty and meaning being apparently the thing sought for both in the letters and the illustrations.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0107.wav|To say a few words on the principles of design in typography:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0108.wav|it is obvious that legibility is the first thing to be aimed at in the forms of the letters;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0109.wav|this is best furthered by the avoidance of irrational swellings and spiky projections, and by the using of careful purity of line.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0110.wav|Even the Caslon type when enlarged shows great shortcomings in this respect:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0111.wav|the ends of many of the letters such as the t and e are hooked up in a vulgar and meaningless way,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0112.wav|instead of ending in the sharp and clear stroke of Jenson's letters;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0113.wav|there is a grossness in the upper finishings of letters like the c, the a, and so on,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0114.wav|an ugly pear-shaped swelling defacing the form of the letter:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0115.wav|in short, it happens to this craft, as to others, that the utilitarian practice, though it professes to avoid ornament,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0116.wav|still clings to a foolish, because misunderstood conventionality, deduced from what was once ornament, and is by no means useful;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0117.wav|which title can only be claimed by artistic practice, whether the art in it be conscious or unconscious.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0118.wav|In no characters is the contrast between the ugly and vulgar illegibility of the modern type|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0119.wav|and the elegance and legibility of the ancient more striking than in the Arabic numerals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0120.wav|In the old print each figure has its definite individuality, and one cannot be mistaken for the other;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0121.wav|in reading the modern figures the eyes must be strained before the reader can have any reasonable assurance|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0122.wav|that he has a 5, an 8, or a 3 before him, unless the press work is of the best:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0123.wav|this is awkward if you have to read Bradshaw's Guide in a hurry.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0124.wav|One of the differences between the fine type and the utilitarian must probably be put down to a misapprehension of a commercial necessity:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0125.wav|this is the narrowing of the modern letters.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0126.wav|Most of Jenson's letters are designed within a square,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0127.wav|the modern letters are narrowed by a third or thereabout; but while this gain of space very much hampers the possibility of beauty of design,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0128.wav|it is not a real gain, for the modern printer throws the gain away by putting inordinately wide spaces between his lines, which, probably,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0129.wav|the lateral compression of his letters renders necessary.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0130.wav|Commercialism again compels the use of type too small in size to be comfortable reading:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0131.wav|"the size known as ""Long primer"" ought to be the smallest size used in a book meant to be read."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0132.wav|"Here, again, if the practice of ""leading"" were retrenched larger type could be used without enhancing the price of a book."|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0147.wav|The position of the page on the paper should be considered if the book is to have a satisfactory look.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0151.wav|the unit of the book being looked on as the two pages forming an opening.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0152.wav|The modern printer, in the teeth of the evidence given by his own eyes, considers the single page as the unit, and prints the page in the middle of his paper|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0153.wav|only nominally so, however, in many cases, since when he uses a headline he counts that in,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0154.wav|the result as measured by the eye being that the lower margin is less than the top one, and that the whole opening has an upside-down look vertically|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0158.wav|it is never used except for very expensive books, although it would not materially increase the cost in all but the very cheapest.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0161.wav|There seems to be no reason why ordinary paper should not be better made,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0162.wav|even allowing the necessity for a very low price; but any improvement must be based on showing openly that the cheap article is cheap,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0163.wav|e.g. the cheap paper should not sacrifice toughness and durability to a smooth and white surface,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0164.wav|which should be indications of a delicacy of material and manufacture which would of necessity increase its cost.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0165.wav|One fruitful source of badness in paper|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0166.wav|is the habit that publishers have of eking out a thin volume by printing it on thick paper almost of the substance of cardboard,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0167.wav|a device which deceives nobody, and makes a book very unpleasant to read.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0168.wav|On the whole, a small book should be printed on paper which is as thin as may be without being transparent.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0169.wav|The paper used for printing the small highly ornamented French service-books about the beginning of the sixteenth century is a model in this respect,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0170.wav|being thin, tough, and opaque.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0171.wav|However, the fact must not be blinked that machine-made paper cannot in the nature of things be made of so good a texture as that made by hand.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0172.wav|The ornamentation of printed books is too wide a subject to be dealt with fully here; but one thing must be said on it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0173.wav|The essential point to be remembered is that the ornament, whatever it is, whether picture or pattern-work, should form part of the page,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0174.wav|should be a part of the whole scheme of the book.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0175.wav|Simple as this proposition is, it is necessary to be stated,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0176.wav|because the modern practice is to disregard the relation between the printing and the ornament altogether,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0177.wav|so that if the two are helpful to one another it is a mere matter of accident.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0178.wav|The due relation of letter to pictures and other ornament was thoroughly understood by the old printers; so that|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0179.wav|even when the woodcuts are very rude indeed,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0180.wav|the proportions of the page still give pleasure by the sense of richness that the cuts and letter together convey.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0181.wav|When, as is most often the case, there is actual beauty in the cuts,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0182.wav|the books so ornamented are amongst the most delightful works of art that have ever been produced.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0183.wav|Therefore, granted well-designed type, due spacing of the lines and words, and proper position of the page on the paper,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0184.wav|all books might be at least comely and well-looking: and if to these good qualities were added really beautiful ornament and pictures,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0185.wav|printed books might once again illustrate to the full|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0186.wav|the position of our Society that a work of utility might be also a work of art, if we cared to make it so.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0008.wav|On the 14th June, 1800, there were 199 debtors and 289 felons in the prison.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0010.wav|these numbers had risen to 275 and 375 respectively, or 650 in all.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0011.wav|For two more years these high figures were steadily maintained, and in 1803 the total rose to 710.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0012.wav|After that they fell as steadily,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0013.wav|till, 1808, the lowest point was touched of 197 debtors and 182 felons, or 379 in all.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0014.wav|The numbers soon increased, however, and by 1811 had again risen to 629; and Mr. Neild was told that there had been at one time|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0015.wav|300 debtors and 900 criminals in Newgate, or twelve hundred prisoners in all.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0016.wav|Previous to that date there had been 700 or 800 frequently, and once, in Mr. Akerman's time, one thousand.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0040.wav|intended to accommodate a couple of prisoners apiece, but often much more crowded.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0041.wav|Two other wards were appropriated to the master's side debtors; they were each twenty-three feet by fourteen and a half,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0055.wav|This arrangement was, however, modified after 1811, and the chapel yard was allotted to misdemeanants and prisoners awaiting trial.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0056.wav|The wards in this part were five in number, all in dimensions twenty feet by fifteen, with a sixth ward fifteen feet square.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0058.wav|The chapel yard led to the chapel, and on the staircase were two rooms frequently set apart for the king's witnesses,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0066.wav|The master felons' side consisted of a yard the same size as the preceding, appropriated nominally to the most decent and better-behaved prisoners,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0121.wav|Fifteen thousand of these were issued in Middlesex alone, which at that time was reckoned as only a fifteenth of Great Britain.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0122.wav|The number of arrests actually made was 114,300 for the kingdom, and 7020 for Middlesex.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0123.wav|Barely half of these gave bail bonds on arrests, and the remainder went to prison.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0132.wav|An elaborate machinery planned for the protection of the trader, and altogether on his side, had long existed for the recovery of debts.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0133.wav|Alfred the Great established the Court Baron, the Hundred Court, and the County Court, which among other matters entertained pleas for debt.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0135.wav|but as time passed, difficulties and delays in obtaining judgment led to the removal of causes to the great Court of King's Bench,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0136.wav|and the disuse of the inferior courts.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0137.wav|So much inconvenience ensued, that in 1518 the Corporation obtained from Parliament an act empowering two aldermen|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0139.wav|under 40 shillings arising within the city.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0140.wav|These courts were extended two centuries later to several large provincial towns, and all were in full activity when Neild wrote,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0142.wav|These courts were open to many and grave objections.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0143.wav|The commissioners who presided were, quote, little otherwise than self-elected|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0145.wav|Often a commissioner had to leave the bench because he was himself a party to the suit that was sub judice.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0146.wav|The activity as well as the futility of these courts may be estimated from the statement given by Neild|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0147.wav|that thirteen hundred and twelve debtors were committed by them to Newgate between 1797 and 1808,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0148.wav|and that no more than 197 creditors recovered debts and costs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0149.wav|The latter indeed hung like millstones round the neck of the unhappy insolvent wretches who found themselves in limbo.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0150.wav|Costs were the gallons of sack to the pennyworth of debt.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0151.wav|Neild found at his visit to Newgate in 1810,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0286.wav|The rooms had no fireplaces, so it mattered little that no coals were allowed.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0291.wav|I come now to the debtors in Newgate. The quarters they occupied were divided, as I have said, into three principal divisions|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0292.wav|the master's side, the cabin side, and the common side. Payment of a fee of 3 shillings gained the debtor admission to the two first named;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0293.wav|those who could pay nothing went, as a matter of course, to the common side;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0294.wav|a further fee was, however, demanded from the new-comer before he was made free of either the master's or the cabin side.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0295.wav|"This was the reprehensible claim for ""garnish,"" which had already been abolished in all well-conducted prisons, but which still was demanded in Newgate."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0296.wav|Garnish on the cabin side was a guinea at entrance for coals, candles, brooms, etc., and a gallon of beer on discharge;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0297.wav|on the master's side it was thirteen and fourpence, and a gallon of beer on entrance, although Mr. Newman,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0298.wav|in his evidence in 1814, said it was more,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0299.wav|and gave the garnish for the common side at that sum, which is five shillings more than Mr. Neild says was extorted on the common side.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0300.wav|Numerous tyrannies were practiced on all who would not and could not pay the garnish.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0301.wav|They were made to wash and swab the ward, or they were shut out from the ward fireplace, and forbidden to pass a chalked line drawn on the floor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0302.wav|and so were unable either to warm themselves or to cook their food.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0303.wav|Besides these fees, legitimate and illegitimate, there were others which must be paid before release.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0304.wav|The sheriff demanded 4 shillings, 6 pence for his liberate, the jailer 6 shillings, 10 pence more, and the turnkey 2 shillings;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0305.wav|and thus when the debtor's debt had been actually paid, or when he had abandoned his property to the creditors, and, almost destitute,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0306.wav|looked forward to his liberty, he was still delayed until he had paid a new debt arising, quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0307.wav|only out of a satisfaction of all his former debts, end quote. The fees were not always extorted, it is true;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0308.wav|nor was non-payment made a pretext for further imprisonment, thanks to the humanity of the jailer, or the funds provided by various charities.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0309.wav|There was this much honest forbearance in Newgate in these days,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0310.wav|that debtors who could afford the cabin and master's side were not permitted to share in the prison charities.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0311.wav|These were lumped together into a general fund,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0312.wav|and a calculation made as to the amount that might be expended per week from the whole sum, so that the latter might last out the year.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0313.wav|It generally ran to about six pounds per week. The money, which at one time had been distributed quarterly, and all went in drink,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0314.wav|was after 1807, through the exertions of the keeper of the jail, spent in the purchase of necessaries.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0315.wav|But this weekly pittance did not go far when the debtors' side was crowded, as it often was;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0316.wav|notably as when numbers filled Newgate in anticipation of Lord Redesdale's bill for insolvent debtors,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0317.wav|and there were as many as three hundred and fifty prisoners in at one time.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0318.wav|The city also allowed the poor debtors fourteen ounces of bread daily, and their share of eight stone of meat, an allowance which never varied,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0319.wav|issued once a week, and divided as far as it would go -- a very precarious and uncertain ration.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0320.wav|The bread was issued every alternate day; and while some prisoners often ate their whole allowance at once,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0321.wav|others who arrived just after the time of distribution were often forty-eight hours without food. The latter might also be six days without meat.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0322.wav|"Share in the weekly allowance of meat might also be denied to debtors who had not paid ""garnish,"" as well as in the weekly grant from the charitable fund."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0323.wav|Hence starvation stared many in the face, unless friends from outside came to their assistance,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0324.wav|or the keeper made them a special grant of 6 pence per diem out of the common stock;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0325.wav|or the sixpenny allowance was claimed for the creditors, which seldom happened, owing to the expense the process entailed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0326.wav|The poor debtors were not supplied with beds. Those who could pay the price might hire them from each other,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0327.wav|or from persons who made a trade of it, or they might bring their beds with them into the prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0328.wav|Failing any of these methods, seeing that straw was forbidden for fear of fire, they had to be satisfied with a couple of the rugs provided by the city|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0329.wav|the supply of which was, however, limited, and there were not always enough to give bedding to all. The stock was diminished by theft;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0330.wav|female visitors carried them out of the prisons, or the debtors destroyed them when the weather was warm,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0331.wav|and they were not in great demand, in order to convert them into mop-heads or cleaning-rags.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0332.wav|Sometimes rugs were urgently required and not forthcoming;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0333.wav|a severe winter set in, the new stock had not been supplied by the contractors, and the poor debtors perished of cold.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0334.wav|Again, there was no regular allowance of fuel. Coals were purchased out of the garnish money and the charitable fund;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0007.wav|hundreds of women and children came in every morning to spend the day there, and there was no limitation whatever to the numbers of visitors admitted to the debtors' side.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0008.wav|Friends arrived about nine a.m., and went out at nine p.m., when as many as two hundred visitors have been observed leaving the debtors' yards at one time.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0009.wav|The day passed in revelry and drunkenness. Although spirituous liquors were forbidden,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0011.wav|that not more than one bottle of wine or one quart of beer could be issued at one time. No account was taken of the amount of liquors admitted in one day,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0013.wav|No attempt was made to check drunkenness, beyond the penalty of shutting out friends from any ward in which a prisoner exceeded.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0014.wav|Quarreling among the debtors was not unfrequent. Blows were struck, and fights often ensued.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0015.wav|"For this and other acts of misconduct there was the discipline of the refractory ward, or ""strong room"" on the debtors' side."|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0017.wav|Order throughout the debtors' side was preserved|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0018.wav|and discipline maintained by a system open to grave abuses, and which had the prescription of long usage,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0020.wav|This was the pernicious plan of governing by prisoners, or of setting a favored few in authority over the many.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0021.wav|The head of the debtors' prison was a prisoner called the steward, who was chosen by the whole body from six whom the keeper nominated.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0022.wav|This steward was practically supreme.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0023.wav|All the allowances of food passed through his hands; he had the control of the poor-box for chance charities,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0024.wav|he collected the garnish money, and distributed the weekly grant from the prison charitable fund.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0025.wav|In the latter duties he was, however, supervised by three auditors, freely chosen by the prisoners among themselves.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0026.wav|The auditors were paid a shilling each for their services each time the poor-box was opened. The steward was also remunerated for his trouble.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0027.wav|He had a double allowance of bread, deducted, of course, from the already too limited portion of the rest,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0028.wav|and no doubt made the meat also pay toll.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0029.wav|Under the steward there were captains of wards, chosen in the same way, and performing analogous duties.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0030.wav|These subordinate chiefs were also rewarded out of the scanty prison rations.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0031.wav|The same system was extended to the criminal side, and cases were on record of the place of wardsman being sold for considerable sums.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0032.wav|So valuable were they deemed, that as much as fifty guineas was offered to the keeper for the post.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0033.wav|Enough has been said, probably, to prove that there was room for improvement in the condition and treatment of debtors in the prisons of the city of London.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0034.wav|This gradually was forced upon the consciousness of the Corporation,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0035.wav|and about 1812 application was made to Parliament for funds to build a new debtors' prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0036.wav|Authority was given to raise money on the Orphans' Fund to the extent of £90,000.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0037.wav|A site was purchased between Red Lion and White Cross streets, and a new prison planned,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0041.wav|There was no lack of air and light for the new jail, and several exercising yards.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0042.wav|The completion of this very necessary building was, however, much delayed for want of funds,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0043.wav|and it was not ready to relieve Newgate till late in 1815.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0044.wav|The reforms which were to be attempted in that prison|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0045.wav|more particularly as regarded the classification of prisoners, and which were dependent on the space to be gained by the removal of the debtors,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0046.wav|could not be carried out till then. It is to be feared that long after the opening of White Cross Street prison,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0047.wav|Newgate continued to be a reproach to those responsible for its management.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0048.wav|I pass now to the criminal side of Newgate, which consisted of the six quarters or yards already enumerated and described.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0049.wav|The inmates of this part, as distinguished from the debtors, were comprised in four classes:|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0051.wav|(2) persons under sentence of imprisonment for a fixed period, or until they shall have paid certain fines;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0053.wav|At one time the whole of these different categories were thrown together pell-mell, young and old, the untried with the convicted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0054.wav|An imperfect attempt at classification was, however, made in 1812, and a yard was as far as possible set apart for the untried,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0055.wav|or class (1), with whom, under the imperious demand for accommodation, were also associated the misdemeanants, or class (2).|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0056.wav|This was the chapel yard, with its five wards, which were calculated to hold seventy prisoners, but often held many more.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0057.wav|A further sub-classification was attempted by separating at night those charged with misdemeanors from those charged with felony,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0058.wav|but all mingled freely during the day in the yard.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0059.wav|The sleeping accommodation in the chapel-yard wards, and indeed throughout the prison, consisted of a barrack bed,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0060.wav|which was a wooden flooring on a slightly inclined plane, with a beam running across the top to serve as a pillow.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0061.wav|No beds were issued, only two rugs per prisoner.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0062.wav|When each sleeper had the full lateral space allotted to him, it amounted to one foot and a half on the barrack bed;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0070.wav|was frequently adjudged for so-called libels, or too out-spoken comments in print.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0071.wav|It was particularly recommended by the Committee on Jails in 1814|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0072.wav|that some other and less mixed prison should be used for the confinement of persons convicted of libels. But this suggestion was ignored.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0073.wav|Indeed the partial classification attempted seems to have been abandoned within a year or two.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0074.wav|The Hon. H. G. Bennet, who visited Newgate in 1817, saw in one yard, in a total of seventy-two prisoners,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0075.wav|thirty-five tried and thirty-seven untried. Of the former, three were transports for life,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0076.wav|four for fourteen years, and three of them persons sentenced to fines or short imprisonment -- one for little more than a month.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0086.wav|The crowding was in consequence of the delay in removing transports.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0275.wav|These malpractices were fostered by the absence of all supervision and the generally unbroken idleness.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0278.wav|Insuperable difficulties were still supposed to stand in the way of any general employment of prisoners at their trades.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0279.wav|There was fear as to the unrestricted use of tools,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0282.wav|Many years were to elapse before these objections should be fairly met and universally overcome.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0283.wav|It was not strange, therefore, that the inmates of Newgate should turn their unoccupied brains and idle hands to all manner of mischief;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0294.wav|This committee made its report in September the following year, and an excellent report it is, so far as its recommendations are concerned.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0295.wav|The committee seems to have fully realized, even at this early date (1815),|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0300.wav|that all prisoners should always be in separate cells by night, and those of short sentences by day.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0301.wav|It recommended day cells or rooms for regular labor, which should be compulsory upon all transports and prisoners sentenced to hard labor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0302.wav|the work being constant and suitable, with certain hours of relaxation and for food and exercise.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0303.wav|The personal cleanliness of all prisoners was to be insisted upon; they should be made to wash at least once a day,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0304.wav|with the penalty of forfeiting the day's allowance of food, an increase of which the committee had recommended.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0305.wav|The provision of more baths was also suggested, and the daily sweeping out of the prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0306.wav|The clothes of prisoners arriving dirty, or in rags, should be fumigated before worn in the jail,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0307.wav|but as yet no suggestion was made to provide prison uniform.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0308.wav|A laundry should be established, and a matron appointed on the female side, where all the prisoners' washing could be performed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0309.wav|Proper hours for locking and unlocking prisoners should be insisted upon;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0311.wav|The committee took upon itself to lay down stringent rules for the discipline of the prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0312.wav|The jailer should be required to visit every part and see every prisoner daily; the chaplain should perform service, visit the sick,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0313.wav|instruct the prisoners, quote, give spiritual advice and administer religious consolation, end quote. to all who might need them;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0314.wav|the surgeon should see all prisoners, whether ill or well, once a week, and take general charge of the infirmaries.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0315.wav|All three, governor, chaplain, and surgeon, should keep journals, which should be inspected periodically by the visiting magistrates.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0316.wav|It should be peremptorily forbidden to the keeper or any officer to make a pecuniary profit out of the supplies of food, fuel, or other necessaries.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0317.wav|No prisoner should be allowed to obtain superior accommodation on the payment of any fees. Fees indeed should be generally abolished, garnish also.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0318.wav|No prisoners should in future be ironed, except in cases of misconduct,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0319.wav|provided only that their security was not jeopardized, and dependent upon the enforcement of another new rule,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0320.wav|which recommended restrictions upon the number of visitors admitted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0321.wav|No wine or beer should be in future admitted into or sold in the jail,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0322.wav|except for the use of the debtors, or as medical comforts for the infirmary.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0323.wav|Drunkenness, if it ever occurred, should be visited with severe punishment;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0324.wav|gaming of all sorts should be peremptorily forbidden under heavy pains and penalties.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0325.wav|The feelings of the condemned prisoners should no longer be outraged by their exposure in the chapel, and the chapel should be rearranged,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0326.wav|so that the various classes might be seated separately, and so as not to see each other.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0327.wav|It will hardly be denied that these proposals went to the root of the matter.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0328.wav|Had they been accepted in their entirety, little fault could in future have been found with the managers of Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0329.wav|In common justice to them, it must be admitted that immediate effect was given to all that could be easily carried out.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0330.wav|The state side ceased to exist, and the female prisoners thus regained the space of which their quadrangle had been robbed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0331.wav|The privileges of the master's side also disappeared; fees were nominally abolished, and garnish was scotched, although not yet killed outright.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0332.wav|A certain number of bedsteads were provided, and there was a slight increase in the ration of bread.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0333.wav|But here the recommendations touched at once upon the delicate subject of expense, and it is clear that the committee hesitated on this score.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0334.wav|It made this too the excuse for begging the most important issue of the whole question.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0335.wav|The committee did not deny the superior advantages offered by such prisons as Gloucester and Petworth,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0336.wav|but it at once deprecated the idea that the city could follow the laudable example thus set in the provinces. Quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0337.wav|Were a metropolitan prison erected on the same lines, with all the space not only for air and exercise, but for day rooms and sleeping cells|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0338.wav|End quote. it would cover some thirty acres, and cost a great deal more than the city, with the example of Whitecross Street prison before it,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0339.wav|could possibly afford.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0340.wav|The committee does not seem to have yet understood that Newgate could be only and properly replaced|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0341.wav|by a new jail built on the outskirts, as Holloway eventually was, and permitted itself to be altogether countered|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0342.wav|and checked in its efforts towards reform by the prohibitory costliness of the land about Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0343.wav|With the seeming impossibility of extending the limits of the prison as it then stood,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0344.wav|all chances of classification and separation vanished, and the greatest evils remained untouched.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0345.wav|All the committee could do in this respect was to throw the responsibility on others.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0346.wav|It pointed out that the Government was to blame for the overcrowding, and might diminish it if it chose.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0347.wav|It was very desirable that there should be a more speedy removal of transports from Newgate to the ships.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0348.wav|Again, there was the new Millbank penitentiary now ready for occupation.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0006.wav|Howard's energy and devotion were rewarded by lively sympathy, but the desire to improve which followed his exposures was but short-lived.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0007.wav|It was so powerless against the persistent neglect of those intrusted with prison management, that, five-and-twenty years later,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0009.wav|as indefatigable and self-sacrificing, found by personal visitation that the condition of jails throughout the kingdom was,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0010.wav|with a few bright exceptions, still deplorable and disgraceful.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0011.wav|"Mr. Neild was compelled to admit in 1812 that ""the great reformation produced by Howard"|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0013.wav|some prisons that had been ameliorated under the persuasive influence of his kind advice were relapsing into their former horrid state of privation,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0014.wav|filthiness, severity, or neglect; many new dungeons had aggravated the evils against which his sagacity could not but remonstrate;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0021.wav|The neglect of prison reform in those days was not to be visited upon the legislature.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0022.wav|The executive, although harassed by internal commotion and foreign war, was not entirely callous to the crying need for amelioration in jails.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0023.wav|Measures remedial, although at best partial and incomplete, were introduced from time to time.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0024.wav|Thus in 1813 the exaction of jail fees had been forbidden by law,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0025.wav|and two other acts more peremptory and precise followed on the same subject in succeeding years.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0026.wav|In 1814 a bill was brought in to insist upon the appointment of chaplains in jails, and when this had passed into law,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0027.wav|it was subsequently amplified, and the rates of salaries fixed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0028.wav|Various acts were also passed to consolidate and amend previous jail acts.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0029.wav|The erection of new prison buildings was made imperative under certain conditions and following certain rules|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0030.wav|the principle of classification was freshly enunciated; prison regulations were framed for general observance.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0031.wav|But the effect of this legislation was rather weakened by the remoteness of the pressure exercised.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0032.wav|The onus of improvement lay upon the magistracy, the local authorities administering local funds,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0034.wav|Moreover, the laws applied more particularly to county jurisdictions.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0035.wav|The borough jails, those in fact under corporate management, were not included in the new measures;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0038.wav|It was in 1817 that a small band of philanthropists resolved to form themselves into an association for the improvement of prison discipline.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0187.wav|Already, as early as 1818, a prison existed at Bury St. Edmunds which was a model for imitation to others at that time,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0189.wav|The great principles of classification, cleanliness, and employment were closely observed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0190.wav|There were eighty-four separate sleeping-cells, and unless the jail was overcrowded, every inmate passed the night alone,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0192.wav|The prison stood on a dry, airy situation outside the town.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0193.wav|Prisoners on reception were treated as they are now-a-days -- bathed, dressed in prison clothes, and inspected by the surgeon.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0194.wav|No irons were worn except as a punishment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0195.wav|Personal cleanliness was insisted upon, and all parts of the prison were kept scrupulously clean.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0196.wav|There was an infirmary, properly found and duly looked after.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0197.wav|No idleness was permitted among the inmates. Trades were taught, or prisoners were allowed to follow their own if suitable.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0198.wav|There was, besides, a mill for grinding corn, somewhat similar to a turn-spit, which prisoners turned by walking in rows.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0199.wav|This made exertion compulsory, and imposed hard labor as a proper punishment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0200.wav|Another jail, that of Ilchester, was also worthy of all commendation. It exhibited all the good points of that at Bury.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0201.wav|At Ilchester the rule of employment had been carried further.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0202.wav|A system not adopted generally till nearly half a century later had already prevailed at Ilchester.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0203.wav|The new jail had been in a great measure constructed by the prisoners themselves.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0204.wav|Masons, bricklayers, carpenters, painters had been employed upon the buildings, and the work was pronounced excellent by competent judges.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0205.wav|Industrial labor had also been introduced with satisfactory results.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0206.wav|Blanket weaving and cloth spinning was carried on prosperously,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0207.wav|and all the material for prisoners' apparel was manufactured in the jail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0208.wav|There were work-rooms for wool-washing, dyeing, carding, and spinning.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0209.wav|The looms were constantly busy. Tailors were always at work, and every article of clothing and bedding was made up within the walls.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0210.wav|There was a prison laundry too, where all the prisoners' linen was regularly washed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0211.wav|The moral welfare of the inmates was as closely looked after as the physical.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0212.wav|There was an attentive chaplain, a schoolmaster, and regular religious and other instruction.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0213.wav|Compared with those highly meritorious institutions Newgate still showed but badly.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0214.wav|Its evils were inherent and irremediable, but some ameliorating measures had been introduced,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0215.wav|mainly through the exertions of a new governor, Mr. Brown, who succeeded Mr. Newman at Newgate in 1817.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0216.wav|The most noticeable of the improvements introduced was a better regulation of dietaries within the prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0217.wav|The old haphazard system, by which meat was issued in bulk,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0218.wav|a week's allowance at a time, was abolished, and there was a regular scale of daily rations adopted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0219.wav|The diet was now ample. It consisted of a pound and a half of bread per diem;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0220.wav|for breakfast a pint of gruel; for dinner half a pound of boiled meat, or a quart of soup with vegetables, on alternate days.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0221.wav|The food was properly prepared in the prison kitchen.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0222.wav|Meat was no longer issued raw, to be imperfectly cooked before a ward fire and bolted gluttonously, the whole two pounds at one sitting.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0223.wav|Mr. Brown confidently asserted that no jail in England now fed its inmates so well as did Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0224.wav|So plentiful was this dietary, that although the old permission remained in force of allowing the friends of prisoners to bring them supplies from outside,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0225.wav|the practice was falling into abeyance, and the prisoners seldom required private assistance to eke out their meals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0226.wav|It was also claimed for the more ample and more orderly distribution of victuals, that the general health of the prisoners had greatly improved.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0227.wav|Mr. Brown also, much to his own credit, brought about the abandonment of the practice of ironing all prisoners as a matter of course.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0228.wav|In 1818 prisoners awaiting trial in Newgate, were at length relieved from this illegal infliction.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0229.wav|Convicts were not even compelled to wear irons, providing they behaved well.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0230.wav|It was found that shackles might be safely dispensed with, even in the case of the most desperate characters.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0231.wav|This was effected by stopping the nearly indiscriminate admission of visitors, which had hitherto prevailed all over the jail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0232.wav|Ironing it will be remembered, was a distinguishing badge, so that when the jail was cleared the free might be readily known from the captive, and escapes prevented.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0233.wav|Under the new rule visitors were not allowed to pass into the interior of the prison, but were detained between the grating.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0234.wav|This change led to some discontent, until it was found that the much greater boon of relief from irons accompanied it, and the reform was quietly accepted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0235.wav|Indeed the best consequences followed from the removal of irons. The prisoners were much better disposed; there were no riots, and fewer disturbances.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0236.wav|But nothing short of radical reform and complete reconstruction could touch the deep-seated evils of association, overcrowding, and idleness.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0237.wav|The first still produced deplorable results -- results to be observable for many years to come.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0238.wav|Mr. Buxton mentions the case of a boy whose apparent innocence and artlessness had attracted his attention.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0239.wav|He had been committed for an offense for which he was acquitted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0240.wav|He left Newgate utterly corrupted, and after lapsing into crime, soon returned with a very different character.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0241.wav|Other cases of moral deterioration have already been recorded.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0242.wav|Some attempt was made to reduce the overcrowding, on the recommendation of the House of Commons Committee of 1818, but this applied only a partial remedy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0243.wav|The bulk of the prisoners were still left in idleness.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0244.wav|A few fortunate criminals, many of them kept back from transportation on purpose, who were skilled in trades, were employed at them.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0245.wav|Painters, plasterers, and carpenters were allowed to follow their handicrafts, with the reward of sixpence per diem and a double allowance of food.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0246.wav|They used their own tools, and this without any dangerous consequences as regards facilitating the escape of others,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0247.wav|thus disposing of the objection so long raised against the industrial employment of prisoners in Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0248.wav|But this boon of toil was denied to all but a very limited number.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0018.wav|an imputation which the Society indignantly and very justly repudiated, the statement being, as they said,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0124.wav|Most of the local authorities embarked into considerable expenditure, determined to rebuild their jails de novo on the most approved pattern,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0126.wav|Religious worship became more generally the rule; chaplains were appointed, and chapels provided for them; surgeons and hospitals also.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0127.wav|Workshops were built at many prisons, various kinds of manufactures and trades were set on foot, including weaving, matting, shoe-making, and tailoring.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0132.wav|Only a few glaring evils still demanded a remedy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0133.wav|The provision of separate sleeping cells was still quite inadequate. For instance,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0134.wav|in twenty-two county jails there were 1063 sleeping cells in all (in 1823)|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0138.wav|that in four prisons, which at one time of the year contained 1308 prisoners, there were only sixty-eight sleeping rooms or cells,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0145.wav|Great want of uniformity in treatment in the various prisons was still noticeable|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0146.wav|and was indeed destined to continue for another half century, in other words, until the introduction of the Prison Act of 1877.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0147.wav|At the time of which I am writing there was great diversity of practice as regards the hours of labor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0148.wav|In some prisons the prisoners worked seven hours a day, in others ten and ten and a half.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0149.wav|The nature of the employment varied greatly in severity, especially the tread-wheel labor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0150.wav|In some county jails, as I have already said, female prisoners were placed upon the tread-wheel;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0151.wav|in others women were very properly exempted from it, and also from all severe labor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0152.wav|Earnings were very differently appropriated. Here the prisoners were given the whole amount, there a half or a third.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0153.wav|Sometimes this money might be expended in the purchase of extra articles of food.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0154.wav|The rations varied considerably everywhere.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0155.wav|It was still limited to bread in some places, the allowance of which varied from one to three pounds;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0156.wav|in others meat, soup, gruel, beer were given.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0157.wav|Here and there food was not issued in kind, but a money allowance which the prisoner might expend himself.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0158.wav|Bedding and clothing was still denied, but only in a few jails;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0159.wav|in others both were supplied in ample quantities, the cost varying per prisoner from twenty shillings to five pounds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0160.wav|It was plain that although the law had defined general principles of prison government,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0161.wav|too much discretion was still left to the magistracy to fill in the details. The legislature only recommended,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0162.wav|it did not peremptorily insist. Too often the letter of the law was observed, but not its spirit.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0163.wav|One great impediment to wide amelioration was that a vast number of small jails lay out of reach of the law.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0164.wav|When the new acts were introduced, numerous prisons under local jurisdiction were exempted from the operation of the law.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0038.wav|a subject of magnitude and importance sufficient to exclude other jails, they soon narrowed their inquiry still further,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0039.wav|and limited it to Newgate alone. Newgate indeed became the sole theme of their first report.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0040.wav|The fact was that the years as they passed, nearly twenty in all, had worked but little permanent improvement in this detestable prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0041.wav|Changes introduced under pressure had been only skin deep.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0042.wav|Relapse was rapid and inevitable, so that the latter state of the prison was worse than the first.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0043.wav|The disgraceful overcrowding had been partially ended, but the same evils of indiscriminate association were still present; there was the old neglect of decency,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0044.wav|the same callous indifference to the moral well-being of the prisoners, the same want of employment and of all disciplinary control.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0045.wav|All these evils were set forth at length in the inspectors' first report.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0046.wav|There was no longer the faintest possible excuse for overcrowding. The numbers now committed to Newgate had sensibly diminished.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0047.wav|The prison had become more or less a place of detention only, harboring mainly those awaiting trial.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0048.wav|To these were still added an average of about fifty expecting the last penalty of the law; a certain number of transports awaiting removal to the colonies;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0051.wav|and for offenses of the most varying description, by the Central Criminal Court.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0052.wav|The sum total thus produced was inconsiderable compared with the hundreds that had formerly filled the jail,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0053.wav|and the whole by proper management might have been so accommodated as to prevent overcrowding.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0054.wav|But incredible as it may appear, the authorities of Newgate declined to avail themselves of the advantages offered them,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0055.wav|and when the population fell they shut up one half the jail and crowded up the other.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0056.wav|Some rooms remained quite empty and unoccupied, while others were full to overflowing.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0057.wav|Not only were the wards thus needlessly crammed, and for no reason but the niggardliness of the corporation which refused a proper supply of bedding|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0058.wav|but the occupants of each were huddled together indiscriminately. The inspectors found in the same wards in the chapel yard the convicted and the untried,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0059.wav|the felon and the misdemeanant, the sane and the insane, the old and young offender.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0060.wav|The classification prescribed by the Jail Act, which laid down that certain prisoners should not intermix, was openly neglected,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0062.wav|In another part there were men charged with and convicted of unnatural offenses shut up with lads of tender years;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0071.wav|No doubt the governor for the time being, Mr. Cope, was in a great measure to blame for all this, and for the want of proper classification.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0072.wav|I shall have occasion to speak again, and more at length, of Mr. Cope's careless and perfunctory discharge|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0073.wav|of his many manifest duties, but I shall here confine myself to animadverting on his neglect as regards the appropriation of his prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0074.wav|He was unable to give any reason whatever for not utilizing the whole of the wards.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0075.wav|He saw certain rooms fill up, and yet took no steps to open others that were locked up and empty.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0076.wav|He blamed the construction of Newgate for the neglect of classification, and was yet compelled to confess that he had made no attempt whatever to carry it out.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0077.wav|The fact was, he did not keep the classification of prisoners on first arrival in his own hands, nor even in that of his officers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0078.wav|A new prisoner's fate, as to location, rested really with a powerful fellow-prisoner.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0079.wav|The inspectors found that prisoners had their places assigned to them|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0080.wav|"by the inner gatesman, himself a convicted prisoner, and a ""wardsman"" or responsible head of a room."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0081.wav|The wardsman still exacted dues, of which more directly,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0082.wav|and this particular official took excellent care to select as residents for his own ward those most suitable from his own point of view.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0085.wav|If a man is poor and ragged, however inexperienced in crime, or however trifling may be the offense for which he has been committed|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0086.wav|his place is assigned among the most depraved, the most experienced, and the most incorrigible offenders in the middle yard.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0087.wav|It must be admitted that so far but little effort had been made to counteract the evils of indiscriminate association.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0088.wav|It was not likely that a system which left innocent men -- for the great bulk of new arrivals were still untried|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0089.wav|to be pitchforked by chance anywhere, into any sort of company,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0090.wav|within this the greatest nursery of crime in London, should exercise even the commonest care for the personal decency or comfort of the prisoners.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0091.wav|Their treatment was also a matter of chance. They still slept on rope mats on the floor, herded together in companies of four or more to keep one another warm|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0092.wav|and under the scanty covering of a couple of dirty stable-rugs apiece.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0093.wav|So closely did they lie together, that the inspectors at their night visits found it difficult in stepping across the room to avoid treading on them.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0094.wav|Sometimes two mats were allotted to three sleepers. Sometimes four slept under the same bedding, and left their mats unoccupied.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0095.wav|The rugs used were never washed; an order existed that the bedding should be taken into the yards to be aired, but it was not very punctually obeyed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0096.wav|The only convenience for personal ablutions were the pumps in the yards, and the far-off baths in the condemned or press-yard.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0097.wav|Water might not be taken into the ward for washing purposes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0098.wav|There was some provision of clothing, but it was quite insufficient, and nothing at all was given if prisoners had enough of their own to cover their nakedness.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0099.wav|The inspectors paraded the prisoners, and found them generally ragged and ill-clad, squalid and filthy in the extreme;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0100.wav|many without stockings, and with hardly shoes to their feet;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0101.wav|some, who had the semblance of covering on the upper part of their feet, had no soles to the shoes, and their bare feet were on the ground.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0102.wav|This, too, was in the depth of the winter, and during a most inclement season.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0103.wav|The allowance of food was not illiberal,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0104.wav|but its issue was precarious, and dependent on the good will of the wardsmen, who measured out the portions to each according to his eye,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0105.wav|and not with weights and measures, no turnkey being present.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0106.wav|Too much was left to the wardsman. It was he who could issue small luxuries;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0107.wav|he sold tea, coffee, sugar, tobacco, although prohibited, and extra beer.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0108.wav|He charged a weekly sum as ward dues for the use of knives, forks, and plates|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0109.wav|a perpetuation under another form of the old detestable custom of garnish.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0110.wav|He had power where his exactions were resisted of making the ward most uncomfortable for the defaulter.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0111.wav|He could trump up a false complaint against his fellow-prisoner, and so get him punished;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0112.wav|he might keep him from the fire, or give him his soup or gruel in a pail instead of a basin.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0113.wav|The authority of these wardsmen so improperly exalted, and so entirely unchecked, degenerated into a baneful despotism.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0114.wav|They bought their offices from one another, and were thus considered to have a vested interest in them.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0115.wav|Their original capital had been a few shillings, and for this they purchased the right to tax their fellows to the extent of pounds per week.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0116.wav|The wardsman had a monopoly in supplying provisions, gave dinner and breakfast at his own price, and was such complete master of the ward|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0117.wav|that none of its inmates were suffered to make tea or coffee for themselves lest it should interfere with his sales.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0118.wav|He made collections when it suited him for ward purposes, to be spent as he chose, in candles and so forth.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0119.wav|When the wardsman was a man of some education, with some knowledge of legal chicanery gained by personal experience, he might add considerably to his emoluments|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0120.wav|by drawing briefs and petitions for his fellows. There was a recognized charge of 5 shillings per brief,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0121.wav|for a petition of from 1 shilling, half pence to 8 shillings, according to its length,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0122.wav|and by these payments a wardsman had been known to amass as much as £40.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0123.wav|The man intrusted with this privilege was often the inner gatesman,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0124.wav|the prisoner official already mentioned, who held the fate of new arrivals as regards location in his hands.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0125.wav|It was not strange that he should sometimes misuse his power, and when prisoners were not to be cajoled into securing his legal services,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0127.wav|in view of speaking to it at the trial, and he could easily do them a good turn -- or a very bad one.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0128.wav|The brief-drawing gatesman and wardsman at the time of the inspectors' first visit must have been a particularly powerful personage.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0129.wav|He was on the most intimate and improperly familiar terms with the turnkeys,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0130.wav|had a key of both the master's side and middle side yards, was the only person present at the distribution of beer, and was trusted to examine,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0131.wav|and, if he chose, pass in, all provisions, money, clothes, and letters brought for prisoners by their friends.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0132.wav|All the wardsmen alike were more or less irresponsible.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0133.wav|The turnkeys complained bitterly that these old prisoners had more power than they themselves.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0134.wav|The governor himself admitted that a prisoner of weak intellect who had been severely beaten and much injured by a wardsman did not dare complain|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0136.wav|These wardsmen, besides thus ruling the roast, had numerous special privileges, if such they can be called.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0137.wav|"They were not obliged to attend chapel, and seldom if ever went; ""prisoners,"" said one of them under examination, ""did not like the trouble of going to chapel."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0138.wav|They had a standing bedstead to sleep on, and a good flock mattress; double allowance of provisions, filched from the common stock.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0139.wav|Nobody interfered with them or regulated their conduct. They might get drunk when so disposed, and did so frequently, alone or in company.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0144.wav|A wardsman did not necessarily lose his situation for it. Nor was drink the only creature comfort he might enjoy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0145.wav|He could indulge in snuff if a snuff-taker,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0146.wav|and might always smoke his pipe undisturbed; for although the use of tobacco had been prohibited since the report of the Lords Committee,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0147.wav|it was still freely introduced into the prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0148.wav|Probably authority would not have been so recklessly usurped by the wardsmen had not the proper officials too readily surrendered it.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0195.wav|This was admitted in evidence by the turnkeys, and was proved by the appearance of the prison tables, which bore the marks of gaming-boards deeply cut into them.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0011.wav|But it was already plain that they constituted an independent authority within the jails; they were frequently in conflict with the chaplain,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0036.wav|one man declared that the language of the condemned rooms was disgusting, that he was dying a death every day in being compelled to associate with such characters.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0037.wav|In the midst of the noisy and blasphemous talk no one could pursue his meditations; any who tried to pray became the sport and ridicule of his brutal fellows.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0038.wav|Owing to the repeated entreaties of the criminals who could hardly hope to escape the gallows, some show of classification was carried out,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0040.wav|in a second room were fourteen more who had every hope of a reprieve.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0041.wav|The whole of these seventeen had, however, a common airing-yard, and took their exercise there at the same time,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0045.wav|They amused themselves after their own fashion; played all day long at blind-man's-buff and leap-frog, or beat each other with a knotted handkerchief,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0049.wav|they suffered sickening anxiety, and wished to be locked up alone. This indiscriminate association lasted for months,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0050.wav|during the whole of which time the unhappy convicts who had but little hope of commutation were exposed to the mockery of their reckless associates.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0051.wav|The brutal callousness of the bulk of the inmates of the press-yard may be gathered from the prison punishment-book, which frequently recorded such entries as the following:|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0054.wav|There were disputes and quarrels constantly among these doomed men; it was a word and blow, an argument clenched always with a fight.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0057.wav|Turnkeys occasionally visited the press-yard, but its occupants were under little or no control.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0059.wav|had relaxed his efforts, because, according to his own account, he was so frequently stopped in the performance of his duties.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0060.wav|"In his evidence before the inspectors he declared that ""for years he gave his whole time to his duties, from an early hour in the morning till late in the afternoon."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0061.wav|He left off because he was so much interfered with and laughed at, and from seeing that no success attended his efforts, owing to the evils arising from association.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0062.wav|Latterly his ministrations to the condemned had been restricted to a visit on Sunday afternoons, and occasionally about once a fortnight on a week-day.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0063.wav|It is only fair to Mr. Cotton to add that, according to his own journal, he was unremitting in his attentions to convicts who were actually cast for death,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0064.wav|and the day of whose execution was fixed. He had no doubt a difficult mission to discharge;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0068.wav|generally sided with his opponents. Nevertheless the inspectors summed up against him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0069.wav|While admitting that he had had many difficulties to contend with,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0074.wav|would, it is probable, have eventually overcome the reluctance of some of the prisoners at least, and would have possessed so much moral dignity|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0076.wav|The lax discipline maintained in Newgate was still further deteriorated by the presence of two other classes of prisoners who ought never to have been inmates of such a jail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0077.wav|One of these were the criminal lunatics, who were at this time and for long previous continuously imprisoned there.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0078.wav|As the law stood since the passing of the 9th George IV. c. 40, any two justices might remove a prisoner found to be insane, either on commitment|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0079.wav|or arraignment, to an asylum, and the Secretary of State had the same power as regards any who became insane while undergoing sentence.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0080.wav|These powers were not invariably put in force, and there were in consequence many unhappy lunatics in Newgate and other jails,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0081.wav|whose proper place was the asylum.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0082.wav|At the time the Lords' Committee sat there were eight thus retained in Newgate, and a return in the appendix of the Lords' report|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0084.wav|The inspectors in the following year, on examining the facts, found that some of these poor creatures had been in confinement for long periods:|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0090.wav|Not only did their presence tend greatly to interfere with the discipline of the prison, but their condition was deplorable in the extreme.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0091.wav|The lunatic became the sport of the idle and the depraved. His cure was out of the question;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0093.wav|The matter was still further complicated at Newgate by the presence within the walls of sham lunatics. Some of those included in the category|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0095.wav|Prisoners indeed were known to boast that they had saved their necks by feigning insanity.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0096.wav|It was high time that the unsatisfactory state of the law as regards the treatment of criminal lunatics should be remedied|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0097.wav|and not the least of the good services rendered by the new inspectors was their inquiry into the status of these unfortunate people, and their recommendation to improve it.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0004.wav|The reasons for this change were fully set forth in a previous chapter.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0005.wav|The terrible spectacle was as demoralizing to the public, for whose admonition it was intended,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0006.wav|as the exposure was brutal and cruel towards the principal actors.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0007.wav|The decision to remove the scene of action to the immediate front of the jail itself|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0008.wav|was in the right direction, as making the performance shorter and diminishing the area of display.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0009.wav|But the Old Bailey was not exclusively used;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0010.wav|at first, and for some few years after 1784, executions took place occasionally at a distance from Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0011.wav|This was partly due to the survival of the old notion that the scene of the crime ought also to witness the retribution;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0012.wav|partly perhaps because residents in and about the Old Bailey raised a loud protest against the constant erection of the scaffold in their neighborhood.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0013.wav|As regards the first, I find that in 1786|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0016.wav|Lawrence Jones, a burglar, was in 1793 ordered for execution in Hatton Garden, near the house he had robbed;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0028.wav|Some indications of pity were offered for the fate of Tilling; Palm, execration alone.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0029.wav|But the Old Bailey gradually, and in spite of all objections urged, monopolized the dread business of execution.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0030.wav|The first affair of the kind on this spot was on the 3rd December, 1783,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0031.wav|when, in pursuance of an order issued by the Recorder to the sheriffs of Middlesex and the keeper of His Majesty's jail, Newgate,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0032.wav|a scaffold was erected in front of that prison for the execution of several convicts named by the Recorder.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0033.wav|Ten were executed|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0034.wav|the scaffold hung with black; and the inhabitants of the neighborhood, having petitioned the sheriffs to remove the scene of execution to the old place,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0035.wav|were told that the plan had been well considered, and would be persevered in.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0036.wav|The following 23rd April, it is stated that the malefactors ordered for execution on the 18th instead|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0037.wav|were brought out of Newgate about eight in the morning, and suspended on a gallows of a new construction.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0038.wav|After hanging the usual time they were taken down, and the machine cleared away in half-an-hour.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0039.wav|By practice the art is much improved, and there is no part of the world in which villains are hanged in so neat a manner, and with so little ceremony.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0040.wav|A full description of this new gallows, which was erected in front of the debtors' door, is to be found in contemporary records.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0041.wav|The criminals are not exposed to view till they mount the fatal stage. The last part of the stage, or that next to the jail,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0042.wav|is enclosed by a temporary roof, under which are placed two seats for the reception of the sheriffs, one on each side of the stairs leading to the scaffold.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0043.wav|Round the north, west, and south sides are erected galleries for the reception of officers, attendants, etc.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0044.wav|and at the distance of five feet from the same is fixed a strong railing all round the scaffold to enclose a place for the constables.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0045.wav|In the middle of this machinery is placed a movable platform, in form of a trap-door, ten feet long by eight wide,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0046.wav|on the middle of which is placed the gibbet, extending from the jail across the Old Bailey.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0047.wav|This movable platform is raised six inches higher than the rest of the scaffold, and on it the convicts stand;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0048.wav|it is supported by two beams, which are held in their place by bolts. The movement of the lever withdraws the bolts, the platform falls in;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0049.wav|and this, being much more sudden and regular than that of a cart being drawn away, has the effect of immediate death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0050.wav|A broadsheet dated April 24th, 1787, describing an execution on the newly-invented scaffold before the debtors' door,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0054.wav|This contrivance appears to have been copied with improvements from that which had been used in Dublin at a still earlier date,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0055.wav|for that city claims the priority in establishing the custom of hanging criminals at the jail itself.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0056.wav|"The Dublin ""engine of death,"" as the gallows are styled in the account from which the following description is taken, consisted of an iron bar"|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0058.wav|From this bar hang several iron loops, in which the halters are tied.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0059.wav|Under this bar at a proper distance is a piece of flooring or platform,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0060.wav|projecting somewhat beyond the range of the iron bar, and swinging upon hinges affixed to the wall.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0061.wav|The entrance upon this floor or leaf is from the middle window over the gate of the prison;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0062.wav|and this floor is supported below,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0063.wav|while the criminals stand upon it, by two pieces of timber, which are made to slide in and out of the prison wall through apertures made for that purpose.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0064.wav|When the criminals are tied up and prepared for their fate, this floor suddenly falls down, upon withdrawing the supporters inwards.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0065.wav|They are both drawn at once by a windlass, and the unhappy culprits remain suspended.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0066.wav|"This mode of execution, it is alleged, gave rise to the old vulgar ""chaff,"" ""Take care, or you'll die at the fall of the leaf."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0067.wav|The machinery in use in Dublin is much the same as that employed at many jails now-a-days.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0068.wav|But the fall apart and inwards of two leaves is considered superior.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0069.wav|The latter is the method still followed at Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0070.wav|The sentences inflicted in front of Newgate were not limited to hanging.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0079.wav|She walked from the debtors' door to a stake fixed in the ground about half-way between the scaffold and Newgate Street.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0080.wav|She was immediately tied by the neck to an iron bolt fixed near the top of the stake,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0081.wav|and after praying fervently for a few minutes, the steps on which she stood were drawn away, and she was left suspended.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0082.wav|A chain fastened by nails to the stake was then put round her body by the executioner with his assistants.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0083.wav|Two cart-loads of faggots were piled about her, and after she had hung for half-an-hour the fire was kindled.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0084.wav|The flames presently burned the halter, the body fell a few inches, and hung then by the iron chain.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0155.wav|Very great excitement prevailed in the town throughout the trial, and this greatly increased when the verdict was known.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0162.wav|Cries of Murder! murder! were now raised, and added greatly to the horrors of the scene.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0163.wav|Panic became general. More women, children, and many men were borne down, to perish beneath the feet of the rest.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0164.wav|The most affecting and distressing scene was at Green Arbor Lane, just opposite the debtors' door of the prison.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0257.wav|In thus describing the saturnalia before the gallows I have been drawn on somewhat beyond the period with which I am at present dealing.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0258.wav|Let me retrace my steps, and speak more in detail of the treatment of the condemned in those bloodthirsty and brutally indifferent days,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0259.wav|and of their demeanor after sentence until the last penalty was paid.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0260.wav|One of the worst evils was the terrible and long-protracted uncertainty as to the result.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0261.wav|In the case of convicted murderers only was prompt punishment inflicted,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0262.wav|and with them indeed this dispatch amounted to undue precipitancy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0263.wav|Forty-eight hours was the limit of time allowed to the unhappy man to make his peace, and during that time he was still kept on a bare allowance of bread and water.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0264.wav|But the murderers formed only a small proportion of the total number sentenced to death, and for the rest there was a long period of anxious suspense,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0265.wav|although in the long run mercy generally prevailed, and very few capitally convicted for crimes less than murder actually suffered.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0266.wav|Thus in the years between May 1st, 1827, and 30th April, 1831,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0267.wav|no less than four hundred and fifty-one sentences of death for capital crimes were passed at the Old Bailey;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0268.wav|but of these three hundred and ninety-six were reversed by the king in council, and only fifty-two were really executed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0269.wav|Already the severity of our criminal code, and the number of capital felonies upon the statute book, had brought a reaction;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0270.wav|and while the courts adhered to the letter of the law, appeals were constantly made to the royal prerogative of mercy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0271.wav|This was more particularly the practice in London.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0272.wav|Judges on assize were satisfied with simply recording a sentence of death against offenders whom they did not think deserved the extreme penalty.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0273.wav|At the Old Bailey almost every one capitally convicted by a jury was sentenced to be hanged.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0274.wav|The result in the latter case was left in the first place to the king in council,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0275.wav|but there was a further appeal then, as now, to the king himself, or practically to the Home Secretary.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0276.wav|Neither in town or country were cases entirely taken on their own merits.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0277.wav|Convicted offenders might have good or bad luck; they might be arraigned when their particular crime was uncommon, and were then nearly certain to escape;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0278.wav|"or theirs might be one of many, and it might be considered necessary to ""make an example."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0279.wav|In this latter it might fairly be said that a man was put to death less for his own sins than for the crimes of others.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0280.wav|The absurdity of the system, its irregularity and cruelty, were fully touched upon by the inspectors of prisons in their first report.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0281.wav|They found at Newgate, under disgraceful conditions as already described,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0282.wav|seventeen capital convicts, upon all of whom the sentence of death had been passed. Eventually two only of the whole number suffered;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0283.wav|two others were sentenced to three months' imprisonment, and the balance to varying terms.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0284.wav|Nothing could be more strongly marked than the contrast between the ultimate destiny of different individuals all abiding the same awful doom:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0285.wav|on the one hand the gallows, on the other a short imprisonment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0286.wav|"The inspectors very properly desired to call attention to the inevitable tendency in this mode of dealing with ""the most awful sanctions of the law,"""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0287.wav|to make those sanctions an object of contemptuous mockery.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0288.wav|The consequences were plainly proved to the inspectors.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0289.wav|"Capitally convicted prisoners did, as a matter of fact, ""treat with habitual and inexpressible levity the sentence of death."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0290.wav|Of this I have treated at length in the last chapter.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0291.wav|The time thus spent varied considerably,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0292.wav|but it was seldom less than six weeks. It all depended upon the sovereign's disposition to do business.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0293.wav|Sometimes the Privy Council did not meet for months, and during all that time the convicts languished with hope|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0294.wav|nearly indefinitely deferred.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0295.wav|"When the council had decided, the news was conveyed to Newgate by the Recorder, who made his ""report,"" as it was called."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0296.wav|The time of the arrival of this report was generally known at Newgate,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0297.wav|and its contents were anxiously awaited by both convicts in the press-yard and their friends collected in a crowd outside the gates.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0298.wav|Sometimes the report was delayed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0299.wav|On one occasion, Mr. Wakefield tells us, the Recorder, who had attended the council at Windsor, did not deliver the report till the following day.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0300.wav|The prisoners and their friends, therefore, were kept in a state of the most violent suspense for many hours,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0301.wav|during which they counted the moments -- the prisoners in their cells as usual, and their friends in the street in front of Newgate, where they passed the night.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0302.wav|I have heard the protracted agony of both classes described by those who witnessed it in terms so strong, that I am unwilling to repeat them.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0303.wav|The crowd of men and women who passed the night in front of Newgate, began, as soon as the hour was passed when they had expected the report,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0304.wav|to utter imprecations against the Recorder, the Secretary of State, the Council, and the King;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0305.wav|they never ceased cursing until the passion of anger so excited was exchanged for joy in some and grief in others.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0306.wav|I myself heard more than one of those whose lives were spared by that decision of the council,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0307.wav|afterwards express a wish to murder the Recorder for having kept them so long in suspense.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0308.wav|The Recorder's report generally reached Newgate late at night.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0309.wav|Its receipt was immediately followed by the promulgation of its contents to the persons most closely concerned,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0310.wav|which was done with a sort of ceremony intended to be impressive.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0311.wav|The whole of the convicts were assembled together in one ward, and made to kneel down.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0312.wav|To them entered the chaplain or ordinary of Newgate in full canonicals,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0313.wav|who in solemn tones communicated to each in turn the fate in store for him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0314.wav|The form of imparting the intelligence was generally the same.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0315.wav|So-and-so, I am sorry to tell you that it is all against you; or,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0317.wav|The fatal news was not always received in the same way.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0006.wav|Before sentence a prisoner has only to observe the regulations of the jail in order to remain neglected and unnoticed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0007.wav|Once ordered to the cells, friends of all classes suddenly rise up; his fellow-prisoners, the turnkeys, the chaplain,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0008.wav|the keepers, and the sheriffs all seem interested in his fate, and he can make no reasonable request that is not at once granted by whomsoever he may address.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0009.wav|This rule has some, but very few, exceptions; such as where a hardened offender behaves with great levity and brutality, as if he cared nought for his life,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0010.wav|and thought every one anxious to promote his death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0011.wav|"Mr. Wakefield goes on to remark that persons convicted of forgery ""excited an extraordinary degree of interest in all who approached them."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0012.wav|This was noticeable with Fauntleroy, who, on account of his birth and antecedents, was allowed to occupy a turnkey's room,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0013.wav|and kept altogether separate from the other prisoners until the day of his death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0014.wav|It cannot be denied, however, that the ordinary's treatment was somewhat unfeeling, and in proof thereof|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0015.wav|I will quote an extract from the reverend gentleman's own journal.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0016.wav|He seems to have improved the occasion when preaching the condemned sermon before Fauntleroy, by pointing a moral from that unhappy man's own case.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0017.wav|For this the chaplain was a few days later summoned before the jail committee of aldermen,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0018.wav|"and informed that the public would not in future be admitted to hear the condemned sermon. ""I was also informed,"" writes Mr. Cotton,"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0019.wav|that this resolution was in consequence of their (the aldermen's) disapproving of the last discourse delivered by me,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0020.wav|previous to the execution of Henry Fauntleroy for uttering a forged security|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0021.wav|in which it was said I had enlarged upon the heinous nature of his crime, and warned the public to avoid such conduct.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0022.wav|I was informed that this unnecessarily harassed his feelings, and that the object of such sermons was solely to console the prisoner,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0023.wav|and that from the time of his conviction nothing but what is consolatory should be addressed to a criminal.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0024.wav|One of the aldermen, moreover, informed me that the whole court of aldermen were unanimous in their opinion on this subject.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0025.wav|As to the exclusion of strangers on these occasions,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0026.wav|the experience I have had convinces me that one, and perhaps the only, good of an execution, i. e. the solemn admonition to the public,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0027.wav|will thereby be lost.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0028.wav|Probably the reader will side with the aldermen against the ordinary.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0029.wav|This episode throws some doubt upon the tenderness and proper feeling exhibited by the chaplain towards the most deserving members of his criminal flock;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0030.wav|and the idea will be strengthened by the following account of the Sunday service in the prison chapel on the occasion when the condemned sermon was preached.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0031.wav|The extract is from Mr. E. Gibbon Wakefield's brochure, the date 1828, just three years after Fauntleroy's death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0032.wav|Strangers were now excluded, but the sheriffs attended in state, wearing their gold chains,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0038.wav|In the center of the chapel was the condemned pew, a large dock-like erection painted black.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0039.wav|Those who sat in it were visible to the whole congregation, and still more to the ordinary,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0040.wav|whose desk and pulpit were just in front of the condemned pew, and within a couple of yards of it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0041.wav|The occupants of this terrible black pew were the last always to enter the chapel.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0042.wav|Upon the occasion which I am describing they were four in number; and here I will continue the narrative in Mr. Wakefield's own words:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0043.wav|First is a youth of eighteen, condemned for stealing in a dwelling-house goods valued above five pounds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0044.wav|His features have no felonious cast;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0045.wav|he steps boldly with head upright, looks to the women's gallery, and smiles. His intention is to pass for a brave fellow,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0046.wav|but the attempt fails; he trembles, his knees knock together, and his head droops as he enters the condemned pew.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0047.wav|The next convict is clearly and unmistakably a villain.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0048.wav|He is a hardened offender, previously cast for life, reprieved, transported to Australia, and since returned without pardon.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0049.wav|For this offense the punishment is death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0050.wav|He has, however, doubly earned his sentence, and is actually condemned for burglary committed since his arrival in England.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0051.wav|His look at the sheriffs and the ordinary is full of scorn and defiance.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0052.wav|The third convict is a sheep-stealer, a poor ignorant fellow in whose crime are mitigating circumstances,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0053.wav|but who is left to die on the supposition that this is not his first conviction, and still more because a good many sheep have of late been stolen by other people.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0054.wav|He is quite content to die;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0055.wav|indeed the chaplain and others have brought him firmly to believe that his situation is enviable, and that the gates of heaven are open to receive him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0056.wav|"The last of the four is said to have been a clergyman of the Church of England, condemned for forgery, ""a miserable old man in a tattered suit of black."|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0058.wav|Great efforts have been made to save his life.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0059.wav|Friends, even utter strangers, have interceded for him, and to the last he has buoyed himself up by hope of reprieve.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0060.wav|Now his doom is sealed irrevocably, and he has given himself up to despair.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0061.wav|He staggers towards the pew, reels into it, stumbles forward, flings himself on the ground, and, by a curious twist of the spine,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0062.wav|buries his head under his body.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0063.wav|The sheriffs shudder, their inquisitive friends crane forward, the keeper frowns on the excited congregation,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0065.wav|and the old clerk lifts up his cracked voice, saying, 'Let us sing to the praise and glory of God.'|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0066.wav|The morning hymn is sung first, as if to remind the condemned that next morning at eight a.m. they are to die.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0119.wav|kneel, whilst the rest of the congregation sit, and the ordinary, in a tone of peculiar solemnity, says,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0120.wav|Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0125.wav|could any one, not disgusted with the religious ceremonials of Newgate, witness this scene without emotion?|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0126.wav|Hardly any one.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0127.wav|But what are the feelings of those who take part in it?|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0128.wav|I have been present at the scene not less than twenty times, and have invariably observed|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0129.wav|that many of the kneeling men or boys laughed while they knelt, pinched each other, and, when they could do so without fear of being seen by any officer of the prison,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0130.wav|winked at other prisoners in derision of what was taking place; and I have frequently heard men and lads who had been of the kneeling party|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0131.wav|boast to their companions after the service that they had wiped their eyes during the thanksgiving, to make the ordinary believe they had been crying.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0132.wav|Although this misapplication of religious services still went on,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0133.wav|the outside public continued to be excluded from the Newgate chapel on the day the condemned sermon was preached.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0134.wav|This very proper rule was, however, set aside on the Sunday preceding Courvoisier's execution.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0135.wav|So many applications for admission were made to the sheriffs,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0136.wav|that they reluctantly agreed to open the gallery which had formerly been occupied by strangers on these occasions.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0137.wav|Cards were issued, and to such an extent, that although the service was not to commence till half-past ten, by nine a.m.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0138.wav|all the avenues to the prison gates were blocked by ticket-holders.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0139.wav|In spite of the throng, owing to the excellent arrangements made by the sheriffs,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0140.wav|no inconvenience was suffered by the congregation, among whom were Lord Adolphus Fitz Clarence, Lord Coventry,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0141.wav|Lord Paget, Lord Bruce, several members of the House of Commons, and a few ladies.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0142.wav|Contemporary accounts give a minute description of the demeanor of the convict upon this solemn occasion.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0143.wav|He sat on a bench before the pulpit, -- the hideous condemned pew had been swept away, -- and never once raised his eyes during the service.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0144.wav|In fact his looks denoted extreme sorrow and contrition,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0145.wav|and he seemed to suffer great inward agitation when the ordinary particularly alluded to the crime for the perpetration of which he stood condemned.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0146.wav|Mr. Carver, the ordinary, appears to have addressed himself directly to Courvoisier,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0147.wav|and to have dwelt with more emphasis than good taste upon the nature of the crime, and the necessity for repentance.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0148.wav|But the chaplain admitted that the solitude of the convict's cell|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0149.wav|was more appropriate for serious reflection and profitable ministration than this exciting occasion before a large and public assembly.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0150.wav|So far as I can find, Courvoisier was the last condemned criminal who was thus exhibited to a crowd of morbidly curious spectators.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0151.wav|The atrocity of the murder no doubt attracted extraordinary attention to it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0152.wav|The crowd outside Newgate on the day of execution has already been described; but there was also a select gathering of distinguished visitors within the jail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0153.wav|First came the sheriffs, the under-sheriffs, and several aldermen and city officials, then Lord Powerscourt and several other peers of the realm.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0154.wav|Mr. Charles Kean the tragedian was also present,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0155.wav|drawn to this terrible exhibition by the example of his father, the more celebrated Edmund Kean, who had witnessed the execution of Thistlewood|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0156.wav|"with a view, as he himself said, ""to his professional studies."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0157.wav|But there is little doubt that as executions became more rare they made more impression on the public mind.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0158.wav|Already a strong dislike to the reckless and almost indiscriminate application of the extreme penalty was apparent in all classes,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0159.wav|and the mitigation of the criminal code, for which Romilly had so strenuously labored, was daily more and more of an accomplished fact.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0160.wav|In 1832|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0161.wav|capital punishment was abolished for forgery, except in cases of forging or altering wills or powers of attorney to transfer stock.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0162.wav|Nevertheless, after that date no person whatever was executed for this offense.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0163.wav|In the same year capital punishment was further restricted, and ceased to be the legal sentence for coining,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0164.wav|sheep or horse stealing, and stealing in a dwelling-house.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0165.wav|House-breaking, as distinguished from burglary, was similarly exempted in the following year;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0166.wav|next, the offenses of returning from transportation, stealing post-office letters, and sacrilege were no longer punishable with death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0167.wav|In 1837 Lord John Russell's acts swept away a number of capital offenses, including cutting and maiming, rick-burning,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0168.wav|robbery, burglary, and arson.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0169.wav|Within a couple of years the number of persons sentenced to death in England had fallen from four hundred and thirty-eight in 1837|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0170.wav|to fifty-six in 1839.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0171.wav|Gradually the application of capital punishment became more and more restricted, and was soon the penalty for murder alone.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0172.wav|While in London, for instance, in 1829, twenty-four persons had been executed for crimes other than murder,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0173.wav|from 1832 to 1844 not a single person had been executed in the metropolis except for this the gravest crime.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0174.wav|In 1837 the death penalty was practically limited to murder or attempts to murder,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0175.wav|and in 1841 this was accepted as the almost universally established rule.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0176.wav|Seven other crimes, however, were still capital by law, and so continued till the passing of the Criminal Consolidation Acts of 1861.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0177.wav|With the amelioration of the criminal code, other cruel concomitants of execution also disappeared.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0178.wav|In 1832 the dissection of bodies cut down from the gallows, which had been decreed centuries previously, was abolished;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0179.wav|the most recent enactment in force was the 9th George IV. cap. 31, which directed the dissection of all bodies of executed murderers,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0180.wav|the idea being to intensify the dread of capital punishment. That such dread was not universal or deep-seated may be gathered from the fact|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0181.wav|that authentic cases were known previous to the first cited act of criminals selling their own bodies to surgeons for dissection.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0182.wav|This dissection was carried out for Newgate prisoners in Surgeons' Hall, adjoining Newgate,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0183.wav|the site of the present Sessions House of the Old Bailey, and the operation was witnessed by students and a number of curious spectators.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0184.wav|Lord Ferrers' body was brought to Surgeons' Hall after execution in his own carriage and six;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0185.wav|after the post mortem had been carried out, the corpse was exposed to view in a first-floor room.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0186.wav|Pennant speaks of Surgeons' Hall as a handsome building, ornamented with Ionic pilasters, and with a double flight of steps to the first floor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0187.wav|Beneath is a door for the admission of the bodies of murderers and other felons. There were other public dissecting rooms for criminals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0188.wav|One was attached to Hicks' Hall, the Clerkenwell Sessions House, built out of monies provided by Sir Baptist Hicks, a wealthy alderman of the reign of James I.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0189.wav|Persons were still living in 1855 who had witnessed dissections at Hicks' Hall, and|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0190.wav|whom the horrid scene, with the additional effect of some noted criminals hanging on the walls, drove out again sick and faint,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0191.wav|as we have heard some relate, and with pale and terrified features, to get a breath of air.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0192.wav|The dissection of executed criminals was abolished soon after the discovery of the crime of burking,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0193.wav|with the idea that ignominy would no longer attach to an operation which ceased to be compulsory for the most degraded beings;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0194.wav|and that executors or persons having lawful possession of the bodies|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0195.wav|of people who had died friendless, would voluntarily surrender them for the advancement of medical science.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0196.wav|Another brutal practice had nearly disappeared about the time of the abolition of dissection. This was the public exhibition of the body,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0197.wav|as was done in the case of Mrs. Phipoe, the murderess, who was executed in front of Newgate in 1798,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0204.wav|A long procession was formed, headed by constables, who cleared the way with their staves.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0208.wav|erected on the cart, about four feet high at the head, and gradually sloping towards the horse, giving a full view of the body,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0209.wav|which was dressed in blue trousers and a blue-and-white striped waistcoat, but without a coat, as when found in the cell.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0212.wav|The countenance of Williams was ghastly in the extreme, and the whole had an appearance too horrible for description.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0237.wav|the poor criminal rose straight upon his feet, with the hangman on his shoulders, and immediately loosened the rope with his fingers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0238.wav|After this the sheriffs sent for another rope, but the spectators interfered, and the man was carried back to jail.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0240.wav|A somewhat similar event happened at Chester not long afterwards; the ropes by which two offenders were turned off broke a few inches from their necks.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0251.wav|White managed to keep his wrists asunder, and continued to struggle with the officials for some time. Eventually he was pinioned with a cord in the usual manner.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0252.wav|On the scaffold he made a violent attempt to loosen his bonds, and succeeded in getting his hands free.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0253.wav|Then with a strong effort he pushed off the white cap, and tried to liberate his neck from the halter, which by this time had been adjusted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0254.wav|The hangman summoned assistance, and with help tied the cap over White's face with a handkerchief.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0255.wav|The miserable wretch during the whole of this time was struggling with the most determined violence, to the great horror of the spectators.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0257.wav|and having got from the falling drop to the firm part of the platform, he nearly succeeded in tearing the handkerchief from his eyes.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0274.wav|His wretched, abject condition, seated in a chair under the drop, was such as almost to unnerve the executioner Calcraft,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0276.wav|Calcraft, the moment he had adjusted the cap and rope, ran down the steps, drew the bolt, and disappeared.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0277.wav|For a second or two the body hung motionless, then, with a strength that astonished the attendant officials,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0280.wav|Again the wretched creature succeeded in obtaining foothold, but this time on the left side of the drop.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0006.wav|Certain crimes, those against the person especially, diminished gradually. They became less easy or remunerative.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0007.wav|Police protection was better and more effective;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0008.wav|the streets of London were well lighted, the suburbs were more populous and regularly patrolled.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0009.wav|People, too, were getting into the habit of carrying but little cash about them, and no valuables but their watches or personal jewelery.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0010.wav|Street robberies offered fewer inducements to depredators, and evil-doers were compelled to adopt other methods of preying upon their fellows.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0011.wav|This led to a rapid and marked increase in all kinds of fraud;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0012.wav|and prominent in the criminal annals of Newgate in these later years will be found numerous remarkable instances of this class of offense --|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0020.wav|the extraordinary extension of all commercial operations led to many entirely novel and often gigantic financial frauds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0021.wav|The credulity of investors, the unscrupulous dishonesty of bankers,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0022.wav|the slackness of supervision over wholly irresponsible agents, produced many terrible monetary catastrophes,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0023.wav|and lodged men like Cole, Robson, and Redpath in Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0024.wav|While the varying conditions of social life thus brought about many changes in the character of offenses against property,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0026.wav|There was no increase in murder or manslaughter; the number of such crimes remained pretty constant proportionately to population.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0027.wav|Nor did the methods by which they were perpetrated greatly vary from those in times past.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0162.wav|The cowardly crime was probably encouraged by the fearless and confiding manner in which the Queen,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0300.wav|Mr. Fauntleroy was a member of a banking firm, which his father had established in conjunction with a gentleman of the name of Marsh, and others.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0303.wav|According to Fauntleroy's own case, he found at once that the firm was heavily involved,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0305.wav|Its embarrassments were greatly increased by the bankruptcy of two of its clients in the building trade,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0306.wav|and the bank became liable for a sum of £170,000.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0307.wav|New liabilities were incurred to the extent of £100,000 by more failures, and in 1819,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0023.wav|A run upon the bank immediately followed, which was only met by a suspension of payment and the closing of its doors.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0026.wav|Fauntleroy was scouted as a licentious libertine, a deep and determined gamester, a spendthrift whose extravagance knew no bounds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0027.wav|The veil was lifted from his private life, and he was accused of persistent immorality.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0028.wav|In his defense|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0029.wav|he sought to rebut these charges, which indeed were never clearly made out, and it is pretty certain that his own account of the causes which led him into dishonesty|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0030.wav|was substantially true|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0031.wav|He called many witnesses, seventeen in all, to speak of him as they had found him; and these, all respectable city merchants and business men,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0032.wav|declared that they had hitherto formed a high opinion of his honor, integrity, and goodness of disposition,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0033.wav|deeming him the last person capable of a dishonorable action.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0034.wav|These arguments availed little with the jury, who after a short deliberation found Fauntleroy guilty, and he was sentenced to death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0035.wav|Every endeavor was used, however, to obtain a commutation of sentence. His case was twice argued before the judges on points of law,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0036.wav|but the result in both cases was unfavorable.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0037.wav|Appeals were made to the Home Secretary, and all possible political interest brought to bear, but without success.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0038.wav|Fauntleroy meanwhile lay in Newgate, not herded with other condemned prisoners, as the custom was,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0039.wav|but in a separate chamber, that belonging to one of the warders of the jail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0040.wav|I find in the chaplain's journal, under date 1824, various entries relative to this prisoner.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0041.wav|Visited Mr. Fauntleroy. My application for books for him not having been attended, I had no prayer-book to give him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0042.wav|Visited Mr. Fauntleroy. The sheriffs have very kindly permitted him to remain in the turnkey's room where he was originally placed; nor can I omit expressing a hope|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0043.wav|that this may prove the beginning of a better system of confinement, and that every description of persons who may be unfortunately under sentence of death|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0045.wav|The kindliness of the city authorities to Fauntleroy was not limited to the assignment of a separate place of durance.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0046.wav|As I have already said, they took the chaplain seriously to task for the bad taste shown in the condemned sermon preached before Fauntleroy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0047.wav|This was on the text,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0048.wav|"Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall,"" and was full of the most pointed allusions to the culprit."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0049.wav|Fauntleroy constantly groaned aloud while the sermon proceeded, and contemporary reports declared|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0050.wav|that he appeared to feel deeply the force of the reverend gentleman's observations, especially when the chaplain spoke of|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0051.wav|the great magnitude of our erring brother's offense, one of the most dangerous description in a trading community.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0052.wav|The sermon ended with an appeal to the dying man, exhorting him to penitence.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0053.wav|"This ""personality,"" and it can be called by no other name, is carefully excluded from prison pulpit utterances on the eve of an execution."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0054.wav|A very curious and, in its way, amusing circumstance in connection with this case was the offer of a certain Italian,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0056.wav|Angelini wrote to the Lord Mayor to this effect,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0057.wav|"urging that Fauntleroy was a father, a citizen: ""his life is useful, mine a burthen, to the State."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0058.wav|"He was summoned to the Mansion House, where he repeated his request, crying, ""Accordez moi cette grâce,"" with much urgency."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0059.wav|There were doubts of his sanity.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0060.wav|He wrote afterwards to the effect that the moment he had offered himself, an unknown assassin came to aim a blow at him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0061.wav|Let this monster give his name; I am ready to fight him. I am still determined to put myself in the place of Mr. Fauntleroy.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0063.wav|Fauntleroy was not entirely dependent upon the ordinary for ghostly counsel in his extremity.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0064.wav|He was also attended by the Rev. Mr. Springett and the indefatigable Mr. Baker, whose name has already been mentioned.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0065.wav|When led out on the morning of his execution, these two last-named gentlemen each took hold of one of his arms, and so accompanied him to the scaffold.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0066.wav|The concourse in front of Newgate was enormous, but much sympathy was evinced for this unfortunate victim to human weakness and ruthless laws.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0067.wav|A report was, moreover, widely circulated, and the impression long prevailed, that he actually escaped death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0068.wav|It was said that strangulation had been prevented by the insertion of a silver tube in his wind-pipe,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0069.wav|and that after hanging for the regulated time he was taken down and easily restored to consciousness.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0070.wav|Afterwards, according to the common rumor, he went abroad and lived there for many years; but the story is not only wholly unsubstantiated,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0071.wav|but there is good evidence to show that the body after execution was handed over to his friends and interred privately.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0072.wav|Some years were still to elapse before capital punishment ceased to be the penalty for forgery, and in the interval|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0073.wav|several persons were sentenced to or suffered death for this crime.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0074.wav|There were two notable capital convictions for forgery in 1828.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0075.wav|One was that of Captain Montgomery, who assumed the aliases of Colonel Wallace and Colonel Morgan.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0076.wav|His offense was uttering forged notes, and there was strong suspicion that he had long subsisted entirely by this fraud.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0077.wav|The act for which he was taken into custody was the payment of a forged ten-pound note for half-a-dozen silver spoons.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0078.wav|Montgomery was an adept at forgery. He had gone wrong early. Although born of respectable parents, and gazetted to a commission in the army,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0079.wav|he soon left the service and betook himself to dishonest ways.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0080.wav|His first forgery was the marvelous imitation of the signature of the Hon. Mr. Neville, M.P., who wrote an extremely cramped and curious hand.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0081.wav|He was not prosecuted for this fraud on account of the respectability of his family, and soon after this escape|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0082.wav|he came to London, where he practiced as a professional swindler and cheat.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0083.wav|For a long time justice did not overtake him for any criminal offense, but he was frequently in Newgate and in the King's Bench for debt.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0084.wav|After three years' confinement in the latter prison he passed himself off as his brother, Colonel Montgomery,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0085.wav|a distinguished officer, and would have married an heiress had not the imposture been discovered in time.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0086.wav|He then took to forging bank-notes, and was arrested as I have described above.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0087.wav|Montgomery was duly sentenced to death, but he preferred suicide to the gallows. After sentence his demeanor was serious yet firm.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0088.wav|The night previous to that fixed for his execution he wrote several letters, one of them being to Edward Gibbon Wakefield, a fellow-prisoner,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0089.wav|and listened attentively to the ordinary, who read him the well-known address written and delivered by Dr. Dodd previous to his own execution for forgery.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0090.wav|But next morning he was found dead in his cell.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0091.wav|"In one corner after much search a phial was found labeled ""Prussic acid,"""|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0093.wav|This phial he had managed to retain in his possession in spite of the frequent searches to which he was subjected in Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0094.wav|The second conviction for forgery in 1828 was that of the Quaker Joseph Hunton, a man of previously the highest repute in the city of London.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0105.wav|His defense was that the forged acceptances would have been met on coming to maturity, and that he had no real desire to defraud.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0106.wav|Hunton accepted his sentence with great resignation, although he protested against the inhumanity of the laws which condemned him to death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0107.wav|On entering Newgate he said,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0108.wav|I wish after this day to have communication with nobody; let me take leave of my wife, and family, and friends. I have already suffered an execution;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0109.wav|my heart has undergone that horrible penalty.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0110.wav|He was, however, visited by and received his wife, and several members of the Society of Friends.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0111.wav|Two elders of the meeting sat up with him in the press yard the whole of the night previous to execution, and a third,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0112.wav|Mr. Sparks Moline, came to attend him to the scaffold.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0113.wav|He met his death with unshaken firmness, only entreating that a certain blue handkerchief,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0114.wav|to which he seemed fondly attached, should be used to bandage his eyes, which request was readily granted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0115.wav|Hunton's execution no doubt aroused public attention to the cruelty and futility of the capital law against forgery.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0116.wav|A society which had already been started against capital punishment|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0117.wav|devoted its efforts first to a mitigation of the forgery statute, but could not immediately accomplish much.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0118.wav|In 1829 the gallows claimed two more victims for this offense.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0119.wav|One was Richard Gifford, a well-educated youth who had been at Christ's Hospital, and afterwards in the National Debt Office.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0120.wav|Unfortunately he took to drink, lost his appointment, and fell from bad to worse.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0121.wav|Suddenly, after being at the lowest depths, he emerged, and was found by his friends living in comfort in the Waterloo Road.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0122.wav|His funds, which he pretended came to him with a rich wife, were really the proceeds of frauds upon the Bank of England.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0123.wav|He forged the names of people who held stock on the Bank books, and got the value of the stock;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0124.wav|he also forged dividend receipts and got the dividends. He was only six-and-twenty when he was hanged.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0125.wav|The other and the last criminal executed for forgery in this country was one Maynard, who was convicted of a fraud upon the Custom House.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0126.wav|In conjunction with two others, one of whom was a clerk in the Custom House,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0127.wav|and had access to the official records, he forged a warrant for one thousand nine-hundred seventy-three pounds and was paid the money by the comptroller general.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0128.wav|Maynard was convicted of uttering the forged document, Jones of being an accessory; the third prisoner was acquitted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0129.wav|Maynard was the only one who suffered death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0130.wav|This was on the last day of 1829. In the following session Sir Robert Peel brought in a bill to consolidate the acts relating to forgery.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0131.wav|Upon the third reading of this bill Sir James Macintosh moved as an amendment that capital punishment should be abolished for all crimes of forgery,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0132.wav|except the forgery of wills and powers of attorney.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0133.wav|This amendment was strongly supported outside the House, and a petition in favor of its passing was presented,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0134.wav|signed by more than a thousand members of banking firms.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0135.wav|Macintosh's amendment was carried in the Commons, but the new law did not pass the Lords, who re-enacted the capital penalty.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0136.wav|Still no sentence of death was carried out for the offense, and in 1832|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0137.wav|the Attorney-General introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment entirely for forgery.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0138.wav|It passed the Commons, but opposition was again encountered in the Lords.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0139.wav|This time they sent back the bill, re-enacting only the two penalties for will forging and the forging of powers of attorney;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0140.wav|in other words, they had advanced in 1832 to the point at which the Lower House had arrived in 1830.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0141.wav|There were at the moment in Newgate six convicts sentenced to death for forging wills.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0142.wav|The question was whether the Government would dare to take their lives at the bidding of the House of Lords,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0143.wav|and in defiance of the vote of the assembly which more accurately represented public opinion. It was indeed announced that their fate was sealed;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0144.wav|but Mr. Joseph Hume pressed the Government hard, and obtained an assurance that the men should not be executed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0145.wav|The new Forgery Act with the Lords' amendment passed into law, but the latter proved perfectly harmless,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0146.wav|and no person ever after suffered death for any variety of this crime.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0147.wav|I will include in this part of the present chapter almost one of the last instances of a crime which in time past|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0148.wav|had invariably been visited with the death penalty, and which was of a distinctly fraudulent nature.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0149.wav|The abduction of Miss Turner by the brothers Wakefield bore a strong resemblance to the carrying off and forcible marrying of heiresses as already described.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0150.wav|Miss Turner was a school-girl of barely fifteen,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0151.wav|only child of a gentleman of large property in Cheshire, of which county he was actually high sheriff at the time of his daughter's abduction.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0152.wav|The elder brother,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0153.wav|Edward Gibbon Wakefield, the prime mover in the abduction, was a barrister, not exactly briefless, but without a large practice.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0154.wav|He had, it was said, a good private income, and was already a widower with two children at the time of his committing the offense for which he was subsequently tried.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0155.wav|He had eloped with his first wife from school.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0156.wav|While on a visit to Macclesfield he heard by chance of Miss Turner, and that she would inherit all her father's possessions.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0157.wav|He thereupon conceived an idea of carrying her off and marrying her willy nilly at Gretna Green.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0158.wav|The two brothers started at once for Liverpool, where Miss Turner was at school with a Mrs. Daulby.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0159.wav|At Manchester, en route, a traveling carriage was purchased, which was driven up to Mrs. Daulby's door at eight in the morning,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0160.wav|and a servant hurriedly alighted from it, bearing a letter for Miss Turner.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0161.wav|This purported to be from the medical attendant of Mr. Turner, written at Shrigley, Mr. Turner's place of residence;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0162.wav|and it stated that Mrs. Turner had been stricken with paralysis.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0163.wav|"She was not in immediate danger, but she wished to see her daughter, ""as it was possible she might soon become incapable of recognizing any one."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0164.wav|Miss Turner, greatly agitated, accompanied the messenger who had brought this news, a disguised servant of Wakefield's,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0165.wav|who had plausibly explained that he had only recently been engaged at Shrigley.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0166.wav|The road taken was via Manchester, where the servant said a Dr. Hull was to be picked up to go on with them to Shrigley.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0167.wav|At Manchester, however, the carriage stopped at the Albion Hotel.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0168.wav|Miss Turner was shown into a private room, where Mr. Wakefield soon presented himself.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0169.wav|Miss Turner, not knowing him, would have left the room, but he said he came from her father, and she remained.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0170.wav|Wakefield, in reply to her inquiries, satisfied her that her mother was well, and that the real reason for summoning her from school|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0171.wav|was the state of her father's affairs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0172.wav|Mr. Turner was on the verge of bankruptcy. He was at that moment at Kendal, and wished her to join him there at once.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0173.wav|Miss Turner consented to go on, and they traveled night and day towards the north.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0174.wav|But at Kendal there was no Mr. Turner, and, to allay Miss Turner's growing anxiety,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0175.wav|Wakefield found it necessary to become more explicit regarding her father's affairs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0176.wav|He now pretended that Mr. Turner was also on his way to the border, pursued by sheriffs' officers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0177.wav|The fact was, Wakefield went on to say, an uncle of his had advanced Mr. Turner £60,000, which had temporarily staved off ruin.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0178.wav|But another bank had since failed, and nothing could save Mr. Turner but the transfer of some property to Miss Turner, and its settlement on her,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0179.wav|"so that it might become the exclusive property of her husband, ""whoever he might be."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0180.wav|Wakefield added that it had been suggested he should marry Miss Turner, but that he had laughed at the idea.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0181.wav|Wakefield's uncle took the matter more seriously, and declared that unless the marriage came off Mr. Turner must be sold up.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0182.wav|Miss Turner, thus pressed, consented to go on to Gretna Green.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0183.wav|Passing through Carlisle, she was told that Mr. Turner was in the town, but could not show himself.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0184.wav|Nothing could release him from his trouble but the arrival of the marriage certificate from Gretna Green.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0185.wav|Filial affection rose superior to all scruples, and Miss Turner, having crossed the border, was married to Wakefield|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0186.wav|by the blacksmith in the usual way.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0187.wav|Returning to Carlisle, she now heard that her father had been set free, and had gone home to Shrigley, whither they were to follow him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0188.wav|They set out, but at Leeds Wakefield found himself called suddenly to Paris;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0189.wav|the other brother was accordingly sent on a pretended mission to Shrigley to bring Mr. Turner on to London, whither Wakefield and Miss Turner also proceeded.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0190.wav|On arrival, Wakefield pretended that they had missed Mr. Turner, and must follow him over to France.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0191.wav|The strangely-married couple thereupon pressed on to Dover, and crossed over to Calais.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0192.wav|The fact of the abduction did not transpire for some days.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0193.wav|Then Mrs. Daulby learnt that Miss Turner had not arrived at Shrigley, but that she had gone to Manchester.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0194.wav|Friends went in pursuit and traced her to Huddersfield and further north.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0195.wav|The terror and dismay of her parents were soon intensified by the receipt of a letter from Wakefield, at Carlisle, announcing the marriage.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0196.wav|Mr. Turner at once set off for London, where he sought the assistance of the police,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0197.wav|and presently ascertained that Wakefield had gone to the Continent with his involuntary bride.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0198.wav|An uncle of Miss Wakefield's, accompanied by his solicitor and a Bow Street runner, at once went in pursuit.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0199.wav|Meanwhile, a second letter turned up from Wakefield at Calais, in which he assured Mrs. Turner that Miss Turner was fondly attached to him,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0200.wav|"and went on to say, ""I do assure you, madam, that it shall be the anxious endeavor of my life to promote her happiness by every means in my power."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0201.wav|The game, however, was nearly up. Miss Turner was met by her uncle on Calais pier as she was walking with Wakefield.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0202.wav|The uncle claimed her. The husband resisted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0203.wav|Monsieur le Maire was appealed to, and decided to leave it to the young lady, who at once abandoned Wakefield.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0204.wav|"As he still urged his rights over his wife, Miss Turner cried out in protest, ""No, no, I am not his wife;"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0205.wav|he carried me away by fraud and stratagem, and forced me to accompany him to Gretna Green|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0206.wav|By the same forcible means I was compelled to quit England, and to trust myself to the protection of this person,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0208.wav|On this Wakefield gave in.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0209.wav|He surrendered the bride who had never been a wife, and she returned to England with her friends, while Wakefield went on alone to Paris.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0210.wav|Mr. William Wakefield was arrested at Dover, conveyed to Chester, and committed to Lancaster Jail for trial at the next assizes,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0214.wav|They were tried in March of the following year, Edward Wakefield having apparently given himself up,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0216.wav|The prosecution pressed for a severe penalty. Edward Wakefield pleaded that his trial had already cost him £3000.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0217.wav|Mr. Justice Bayley, in summing up,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0218.wav|spoke severely of the gross deception practiced upon an innocent girl, and sentenced the brothers each to three years' imprisonment,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0220.wav|The marriage was annulled by an Act of Parliament, although Wakefield petitioned against it,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0221.wav|and was brought from Newgate, at his own request, to oppose the second reading of the bill.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0222.wav|He also wrote and published a pamphlet from the jail to show that Miss Turner had been a consenting party to the marriage, and was really his wife.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0223.wav|Neither his address nor his pamphlet availed much, for the bill for the divorce passed both Houses.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0224.wav|That Mr. Wakefield was a shrewd critic and close observer of all that went on in the Newgate of those days,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0242.wav|Howard replied, desiring Mr. Mullay to call upon him in a house in Red Lion Square.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0243.wav|Mr. Mullay went, and a second interview was agreed upon, when a third person, Mr. Owen,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0246.wav|there were weapons in the room -- a long knife, a heavy trap-ball bat, and a poker.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0247.wav|Mr. Mullay became alarmed, and as Mr. Owen did not appear, withdrew;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0281.wav|Then, as they warned him that he would be kept a prisoner in total darkness in this horrible den until he agreed to their demands,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0283.wav|One was a cheque for £800 on his bankers, the other an order to Mr. Bell of Newport, Essex, requesting the surrender of a deed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0284.wav|His captors having thus succeeded in their designs, left him, no doubt to realize the money.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0285.wav|The door of his place of durance stood open, and Mr. Gee began to consider whether he might not escape.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0287.wav|but at length managed to wriggle out of the chain which confined his body, and soon loosened the ropes round his feet.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0288.wav|Thus free, he eluded the vigilance of two of the party, who were at dinner in the front kitchen,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0290.wav|His first act was to send a messenger to stop the cheque and the order to Mr. Bell, his next to seek the help of the police.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0006.wav|A watch was set on him at her house, where he was soon afterwards arrested.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0007.wav|Edwards, whom Mr. Gee easily identified with the others, at once admitted that he was the prime mover of the conspiracy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0008.wav|He had sought by all legal means to obtain possession of the £2000, but had failed, and had had recourse to more violent means.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0009.wav|It turned out that he was really married to Mrs. Canning,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0010.wav|both having been recognized by the clergyman who had performed the ceremony, and the assault had been committed to secure the money|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0012.wav|All three men were committed for trial, although Edwards wished to exculpate the others as having only acted under his order.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0013.wav|At the trial the indictment charging them with felony could not be sustained, but they were found guilty of conspiracy and assault.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0020.wav|He began as an itinerant street vendor at eight, at ten he passed bad money,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0021.wav|"at fourteen he was a pickpocket and a ""duffer,"" or a seller of sham goods."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0022.wav|He early saw the profits to be made out of purchasing stolen goods, but could not embark in it at first for want of capital.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0023.wav|He was taken up when still in his teens for stealing a pocketbook, and was sentenced to transportation, but did not get beyond the hulks at Chatham.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0026.wav|With this capital he returned to London and set up as a fence.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0027.wav|He had such great aptitude for business, and such a thorough knowledge of the real value of goods,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0028.wav|that he was soon admitted to be one of the best judges known of all kinds of property, from a glass bottle to a five hundred guinea chronometer.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0029.wav|But he never paid more than a fixed price for all articles of the same class, whatever their intrinsic value.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0030.wav|Thus, a watch was paid for as a watch, whether it was of gold or silver; a piece of linen as such, whether the stuff was coarse or fine.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0031.wav|This rule in dealing with stolen goods continues to this day, and has made the fortune of many since Ikey.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0032.wav|Solomons also established a system of provincial agency, by which stolen goods were passed on from London to the seaports, and so abroad.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0033.wav|Jewels were re-set,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0035.wav|the number and names on watches, were carefully removed or obliterated after the goods passed out of his hands.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0036.wav|On one occasion the whole of the proceeds of a robbery from a boot shop was traced to Solomons';|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0037.wav|the owner came with the police, and was morally convinced that it was his property,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0038.wav|but could not positively identify it, and Ikey defied them to remove a single shoe.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0039.wav|In the end the injured bootmaker agreed to buy back his stolen stock|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0040.wav|at the price Solomons had paid for it, and it cost him about a hundred pounds to re-stock his shop with his own goods.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0041.wav|As a general rule Ikey Solomons confined his purchases to small articles, mostly of jewelery and plate,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0042.wav|which he kept concealed in a hiding-place with a trap-door just under his bed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0043.wav|He lived in Rosemary Lane, and sometimes he had as much as £20,000 worth of goods secreted on the premises.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0044.wav|When his trade was busiest he set up a second establishment, at the head of which, although he was married,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0046.wav|The second house was in Lower Queen Street, Islington, and he used it for some time as a depot for valuables.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0049.wav|led him to think seriously of trying his fortunes in another land.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0050.wav|He was about to emigrate to New South Wales, when he was arrested at Islington and committed to Newgate on a charge of receiving stolen goods.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0051.wav|While thus incarcerated he managed to escape from custody, but not actually from jail, by an ingenious contrivance which is worth mentioning.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0052.wav|He claimed to be admitted to bail, and was taken from Newgate on a writ of habeas before one of the judges sitting at Westminster.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0053.wav|He was conveyed in a coach driven by a confederate, and under the escort of a couple of turnkeys.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0054.wav|"Solomons, while waiting to appear in court, persuaded the turnkeys to take him to a public-house, where all might ""refresh."""|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0200.wav|Bishop got weary of the dangers and fatigues of exhumation, and proposed to Williams that instead of disinterring they should murder their subjects.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0201.wav|Bishop confessed that he was moved to this by the example of Burke and Hare.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0202.wav|They pursued their terrible trade for five years without scruple and without detection.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0209.wav|and after some haggling they agreed on a price, and in the afternoon the snatchers brought a hamper which contained a body in a sack.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0210.wav|The porter received it, but from its freshness became suspicious of foul play.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0213.wav|An inquest was held on the body, which was identified as that of an Italian boy,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0214.wav|Carlo Ferrari, who made a living by exhibiting white mice about the streets,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0215.wav|and the jury returned a verdict of willful murder against persons unknown, expressing a strong opinion that Bishop,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0216.wav|Williams, and May had been concerned in the transaction.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0217.wav|Meanwhile, a search had been made at Nova Scotia Gardens, Bethnal Green, where Bishop and Williams lived.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0218.wav|At first nothing peculiar was found; but at a second search the back-garden ground was dug up,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0219.wav|and in one corner, at some depth, a bundle of clothes were unearthed, which, with a hairy cap,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0220.wav|were known to be what Ferrari had worn when last seen.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0221.wav|In another portion of the garden more clothing, partly male and partly female, was discovered,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0223.wav|These facts were represented before the police magistrate|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0224.wav|"who examined Bishop and his fellows, and further incriminating evidence adduced, to the effect that the prisoners had bartered for a coach to carry ""a stiff 'un"";"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0225.wav|they had also been seen to leave their cottage, carrying out a sack with something heavy inside. On this they were fully committed to Newgate for trial.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0226.wav|This trial came off in due course at the Central Criminal Court, where the prisoners were charged on two counts,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0227.wav|one that of the murder of the Italian boy, the other that of a boy unknown.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0228.wav|The evidence from first to last was circumstantial,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0229.wav|but the jury, after a short deliberation, did not hesitate to bring in a verdict of guilty, and all three were condemned to death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0230.wav|Shortly before the day fixed for execution, Bishop made a full confession, the bulk of which bore the impress of truth,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0231.wav|although it included statements that were improbable and unsubstantiated.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0232.wav|He asserted that the victim was a Lincolnshire lad, and not an Italian boy, although the latter was fully proved.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0233.wav|According to the confession, death had been inflicted by drowning in a well, whereas the medical evidence all pointed to violence.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0234.wav|It was, however, pretty clear that this victim, like preceding ones, had been lured to Nova Scotia Gardens, and there drugged with a large dose of laudanum.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0235.wav|While they were in a state of insensibility the murder was committed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0236.wav|Bishop's confession was endorsed by Williams, and the immediate result was the respite of May.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0237.wav|A very painful scene occurred in Newgate when the news of his escape from death was imparted to May.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0238.wav|He fainted, and the warrant of mercy nearly proved his death-blow. The other two looked on at his agitation with an indifference amounting to apathy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0239.wav|The execution took place a week or two later, in the presence of such a crowd as had not been seen near Newgate for years.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0240.wav|I will close this chapter with a brief account of another murder,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0241.wav|the memory of which is still fresh in the minds of Londoners, although half a century has passed since it was committed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0242.wav|The horror with which Greenacre's crime struck the town was unparalleled since the time when Catherine Hayes slew her husband.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0243.wav|There were many features of resemblance in these crimes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0244.wav|The decapitation and dismemberment, the bestowal of the remains in various parts of the town, the preservation of the head in spirits of wine,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0245.wav|in the hope that the features might some day be recognized, were alike in both.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0246.wav|The murder in both cases was long a profound mystery. In this which I am now describing,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0247.wav|a bricklayer found a human trunk near some new buildings in the Edgeware Road, one morning in the last week of 1836.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0248.wav|The inquest on these remains, which medical examination showed to be those of a female,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0249.wav|returned a verdict of willful murder against some person unknown.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0250.wav|On the 7th July, 1837,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0251.wav|"the lockman of ""Ben Jonson lock,"" in Stepney Fields, found a human head jammed into the lock gates."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0252.wav|Closer investigation proved that it belonged to the trunk already discovered on the 2nd February.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0253.wav|A further discovery was made in an osier bed near Cold Harbor Lane, Camberwell,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0254.wav|where a workman found a bundle containing two human legs, in a drain.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0255.wav|These were the missing members of the same mutilated trunk,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0256.wav|and there was now evidence sufficient to establish conclusively that the woman thus collected piecemeal had been barbarously done to death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0257.wav|But the affair still remained a profound mystery. No light was thrown upon it till, towards the end of March,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0258.wav|a Mr. Gay of Goodge Street came to view the head, and immediately recognized it as that of a widowed sister, Hannah Brown,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0259.wav|who had been missing since the previous Christmas Day.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0260.wav|The murdered individual was thus identified. The next step was to ascertain where and with whom she had last been seen.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0261.wav|This brought suspicion on to a certain James Greenacre,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0262.wav|whom she was to have married, and in whose company she had left her own lodgings to visit his in Camberwell.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0263.wav|The police wished to refer to Greenacre, but as he was not forthcoming,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0264.wav|a warrant was issued for his apprehension, which was effected at Kennington on the 24th March.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0265.wav|A woman named Gale, who lived with him, was arrested at the same time. The prisoners were examined at the Marylebone police court.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0266.wav|Greenacre, a stout, middle-aged man, wrapped in a brown greatcoat, assumed an air of insolent bravado;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0267.wav|but his despair must have been great, as was evident from his attempt to strangle himself in the station-house.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0268.wav|Suspicion grew almost to certainty as the evidence was unfolded.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0269.wav|Mrs. Brown was a washer-woman, supposed to be worth some money; hence Greenacre's offer of marriage.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0270.wav|She had realized all her effects, and brought them with her furniture to Greenacre's lodgings. The two when married were to emigrate to Hudson's Bay.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0271.wav|Whether it was greed or a quarrel that drove Greenacre to the desperate deed remains obscure.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0272.wav|"They were apparently good friends when last seen together at a neighbor's, where they seemed ""perfectly happy and sociable, and eager for the wedding day."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0273.wav|But Greenacre in his confession pretended that he and his intended had quarreled over her property or the want of it,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0274.wav|and that in a moment of anger he knocked her down.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0275.wav|He thought he had killed her, and in his terror began at once to consider how he might dispose of the body and escape arrest.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0276.wav|While she was senseless, but really still alive, he cut off her head, and dismembered the body in the manner already described.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0277.wav|It is scarcely probable that he would have gone to this extremity if he had had no previous evil intention,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0278.wav|and the most probable inference is that he inveigled Mrs. Brown to his lodgings with the set purpose of taking her life.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0279.wav|His measures for the disposal of the corpus delicti remind us of those taken by Mrs. Hayes and her associates,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0280.wav|or of Gardelle's frantic efforts to conceal his crime.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0281.wav|The most ghastly part of the story is that which deals with his getting rid of the head.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0282.wav|This, wrapped up in a silk handkerchief,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0283.wav|he carried under his coat-flaps through the streets, and afterwards on his cap in a crowded city omnibus.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0284.wav|It was not until he left the bus, and walked up by the Regent's Canal, that he conceived the idea of throwing the head into the water.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0285.wav|Another day elapsed before he got rid of the rest of the body,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0286.wav|all of which, according to his own confession, made no doubt with the idea of exonerating Mrs. Gale, he accomplished without her assistance.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0287.wav|On the other hand, it was adduced in evidence that Mrs. Gale had been at his lodgings the very day after the murder,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0288.wav|and was seen to be busily engaged in washing down the house with bucket and mop.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0289.wav|Greenacre, when tried at the Old Bailey, admitted that he had been guilty of manslaughter.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0290.wav|While conversing with Mrs. Brown, he declared the unfortunate woman was rocking herself to and fro in a chair;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0291.wav|as she leant back he put his foot against the chair, and so tilted it over.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0292.wav|Mrs. Brown fell with it, and Greenacre, to his horror, found that she was dead.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0293.wav|But the medical evidence was clear that the decapitation had been effected during life, and the jury, after a short deliberation,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0294.wav|without hesitation brought in a verdict of willful murder.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0295.wav|The woman Gale was also found guilty, but sentence of death was only passed on Greenacre.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0296.wav|The execution was, as usual, attended by an immense concourse, and Greenacre died amidst the loudest execrations.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0004.wav|The most extensive and systematic robberies were planned and carried out so as long to escape detection.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0005.wav|One of the earliest of the big operators in fraudulent finance was Edward Beaumont Smith,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0006.wav|who was convicted in 1841 of uttering false exchequer bills to an almost fabulous amount.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0007.wav|A not entirely novel kind of fraud, but one carried out on a larger scale than heretofore,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0008.wav|came to light in this same year, 1841.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0009.wav|This was the willful shipwreck and casting away of a vessel which, with her supposed cargo, had been heavily insured.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0010.wav|The 'Dryad' was a brig owned principally by two persons named Wallace, one a seaman, the other merchant.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0011.wav|She was freighted by the firm of Zulueta and Co. for a voyage to Santa Cruz.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0012.wav|Her owners insured her for a full sum of £2000, after which the Wallaces insured her privily|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0013.wav|with other underwriters for a second sum of £2000.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0014.wav|After this, on the faith of forced bills of lading, the captain, Loose by name,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0015.wav|being a party to the intended fraud, they obtained further insurances on goods never shipped.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0016.wav|It was fully proved in evidence that when the Dryad sailed she carried nothing but the cargo belonging to Zulueta and Co.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0019.wav|Loose had his instructions to cast away the ship on the first possible opportunity, and from the time of his leaving Liverpool|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0020.wav|he acted in a manner which excited the suspicions of the crew.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0021.wav|The larboard pump was suffered to remain choked up, and the long-boat was fitted with tackles and held ready for use at a moment's notice.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0022.wav|The ship, however, met with exasperatingly fine weather, and it was not until the captain reached the West India Islands|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0023.wav|that he got a chance of accomplishing his crime.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0024.wav|At a place called the Silver Keys he ran the ship on the reef.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0025.wav|But another ship, concluding that he was acting in ignorance, rendered him assistance.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0027.wav|He crept along the coast close in shore, looking for a quiet spot to cast away the ship,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0028.wav|and at last, when within fifteen miles of port, with wind and weather perfectly fair, he ran her on to the rocks.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0029.wav|Even then she might have been saved, but the captain would not suffer the crew to act. Nearly the whole of the cargo was lost as well as the ship.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0165.wav|The housemaid suggested that they should see if his lordship was all right, and the three went to his bedroom.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0166.wav|While Courvoisier opened the shutters, the housemaid, approaching the bed, saw that the pillow was saturated with blood.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0167.wav|The discovery of the murdered man immediately followed. The neighborhood was alarmed, the police sent for, and a close inquiry forthwith commenced.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0168.wav|That Lord William Russell had committed suicide was at once declared impossible.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0169.wav|It was also clearly proved that no forcible entry had been made into the house;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0170.wav|the fresh marks of violence upon the door had evidently been made inside, and not from outside;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0171.wav|moreover, the instruments, poker and chisel, by which they had no doubt been effected,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0172.wav|were found in the butler's pantry, used by Courvoisier.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0173.wav|The researches of the police soon laid bare other suspicious facts.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0174.wav|The bundle found in the dining-room contained, with clothes, various small articles of plate and jewelery which a thief would probably have put into his pocket.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0175.wav|Upstairs in the bedroom a rouleaux box for sovereigns had been broken open,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0176.wav|also the jewel-box and note-case, from the latter of which was abstracted a ten-pound note known to have been in the possession of the deceased.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0177.wav|His lordship's watch was gone.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0178.wav|Further suspicion was caused by the position of a book and a wax candle by the bedside.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0179.wav|The latter was so placed that it could throw no light on the former, which was a 'Life of Sir Samuel Romilly.'|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0180.wav|The intention of the real murderer to shift the crime to burglars was evident although futile,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0181.wav|and the police, feeling convinced that the crime had been committed by some inmate of the house,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0182.wav|took Courvoisier into custody, and placed the two female servants under surveillance.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0183.wav|The valet's strange demeanor had attracted attention from the first.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0184.wav|He had hung over the body in a state of dreadful agitation, answering no questions, and taking no part in the proceedings.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0185.wav|Three days later a close search of the butler's pantry produced fresh circumstantial evidence.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0186.wav|Behind the skirting board several of his lordship's rings were discovered;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0187.wav|near it was his Waterloo medal, and the above-mentioned ten-pound note.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0188.wav|Further investigation was rewarded by the discovery in the pantry of a split gold ring, used by Lord William to carry his keys on;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0189.wav|next, and in the same place, a chased gold key;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0190.wav|and at last his lordship's watch was found secreted under the leads of the sink.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0191.wav|All this was evidence sufficient to warrant Courvoisier's committal for trial;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0192.wav|but still he found friends, and a liberal subscription was raised among the foreign servants in London to provide funds for his defense.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0193.wav|Courvoisier, when put on his trial, pleaded not guilty;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0194.wav|but on the second day the discovery of fresh evidence, more particularly the recovery of some of Lord William's stolen plate,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0195.wav|induced the prisoner to make a full confession of his crime to the lawyers who defended him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0196.wav|This placed them in a position of much embarrassment. To have thrown up their brief would have been to have secured Courvoisier's conviction.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0197.wav|Mr. Phillips, who led in the case, went to the other extreme,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0198.wav|and in an impassioned address implored the jury not to send an innocent man to the gallows.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0199.wav|It will be remembered that the question whether Mr. Phillips had not exceeded the limits usually allowed to counsel was much debated at the time.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0200.wav|The jury without hesitation found Courvoisier guilty, and he was sentenced to death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0201.wav|The prisoner's demeanor had greatly changed during the trial.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0202.wav|Coolness amounting almost to effrontery gave way to hopeless dejection.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0203.wav|On his removal to Newgate after sentence,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0204.wav|he admitted that he had been justly convicted, and expressed great anxiety that his fellow-servants should be relieved from all suspicion.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0205.wav|Later in the day he tried to commit suicide by cramming a towel down his throat, but was prevented.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0206.wav|Next morning he made a full confession in presence of his attorney, and the governor, Mr. Cope.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0207.wav|In this he gave as the motives of his crime a quarrel he had with his master, who threatened to discharge him without a character.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0208.wav|Lord William, according to the valet, was of a peevish, difficult temper;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0209.wav|he was annoyed with his man for various small omissions and acts of forgetfulness, and on the night of the murder had taken Courvoisier to task rather sharply.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0210.wav|Finally, on coming downstairs after bed-time, Lord William had found Courvoisier in the dining-room.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0211.wav|What are you doing here? asked his lordship.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0212.wav|You can have no good intentions; you must quit my service tomorrow morning.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0213.wav|This seems to have decided Courvoisier,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0214.wav|who took a carving-knife from the sideboard in the dining-room, went upstairs to Lord William's bedroom, and drew the knife across his throat.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0215.wav|He appeared to die instantly, said the murderer, in conclusion.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0216.wav|His account of his acts and movements after the deed|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0217.wav|varied so considerably in the several documents he left behind, that too much reliance cannot be placed upon his confession.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0218.wav|"His last statement contains the words, ""The public now think I am a liar, and they will not believe me when I say the truth."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0219.wav|This was no doubt the case, but this much truth his confession may be taken to contain:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0220.wav|that Courvoisier was idle, discontented, ready to take offense, greedy of gain;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0221.wav|that he could not resist the opportunity for robbery offered him by his situation at Lord William Russell's; that when vexed with his master|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0222.wav|he did not shrink from murder, both for revenge and to conceal his other crimes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0223.wav|Courvoisier wished to commit suicide in Newgate, but was prevented by the vigilant supervision to which he was subjected while in jail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0224.wav|The attempt was to have been made by opening a vein and allowing himself to bleed to death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0225.wav|The Sunday night before his execution he would not go to bed when ordered.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0226.wav|The governor insisted, but Courvoisier showed great reluctance to strip.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0227.wav|The order was, however, at length obeyed, and the whole of the prisoner's clothes were minutely searched.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0228.wav|In the pocket of the coat Mr. Cope, the governor, found a neatly-folded cloth, and asked what it was for.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0229.wav|Courvoisier admitted that he had intended to bind it tightly round his arm and bleed himself to death in the night.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0230.wav|"The next inquiry was how he hoped to open a vein. ""With a bit of sharpened stick picked out of the ordinary firewood."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0231.wav|Where is it? asked the governor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0232.wav|The prisoner replied that he had left it in the mattress of which he had just been deprived.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0233.wav|The bed was searched, but no piece of sharpened wood was found. It was thought that it might have been lost in changing the mattresses.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0234.wav|The cloth above referred to belonged to the inner seam of his trousers, which he had managed to tear out.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0235.wav|There is nothing to show that Courvoisier really contemplated self-destruction.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0236.wav|A murder which reproduced many of the features of that committed by Greenacre soon followed, and excited the public mind even more than that of Courvoisier's.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0237.wav|Daniel Good's crime might have remained long undiscovered but for his own careless stupidity.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0238.wav|He was coachman to a gentleman at Roehampton. One day he went into a pawnbroker's at Wandsworth, and bought a pair of breeches on credit.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0239.wav|At the same time he was seen to steal and secrete a pair of trousers. The shop-boy gave information.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0240.wav|Good was followed to his stables by a policeman, but obstinately denied the theft.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0241.wav|The policeman insisted on searching the premises, at which Good displayed some uneasiness.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0242.wav|This increased when the officer, accompanied by two others, a neighbor and a bailiff, entered one of the stables.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0243.wav|Good now offered to go to Wandsworth and satisfy the pawnbroker.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0244.wav|Just at this moment, however, the searchers found concealed under two trusses of hay a woman's headless and dismembered trunk.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0246.wav|Some time elapsed before the imprisoned party could force open the doors, and by then the fugitive had escaped.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0256.wav|Good had told her, much to her perturbation, that she was to move from South Street to Roehampton, and one day he fetched her.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0257.wav|They were seen together on Barnes Common, and again in Putney Park Lane, where they were talking loud and angrily.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0162.wav|But it may be mentioned that the concourse was so enormous that it drew down the well-merited and trenchant disapproval of Charles Dickens,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0173.wav|It was understood also that he had served in the army as a private, and had, moreover, undergone a sentence of transportation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0174.wav|But it was supposed that he had been once in a good position, well born, and well educated.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0175.wav|When lying under sentence of death in Newgate, he was visited by a lady, a gentlewoman in every sense of the word, who was said to be his sister.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0176.wav|His determined addiction to evil courses had led to his being cast off by his family,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0177.wav|and he must have been at the end of his resources when he committed the crime for which he suffered.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0178.wav|His offense was the murder of Richard Cope,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0179.wav|a working jeweler, shopman to a Mr. Berry of Parliament Street. It was Cope's duty to stay in the shop till the last, close the shutters,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0181.wav|Cope, a small man, crippled, and of weakly constitution, was alone in the shop about 9:30.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0182.wav|the shutters were up, and he was preparing to close, when Marley entered and fell upon him with a life-preserver,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0183.wav|meaning to kill him and rifle the shop.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0184.wav|The noise of the struggle was heard outside in the street,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0185.wav|and bystanders peeped in through the shutters, but no one entered or sought to interfere in what seemed only a domestic quarrel.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0186.wav|A milliner's porter,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0187.wav|Lerigo, was also attracted by the noise of the row, but after walking a few paces he felt dissatisfied, and returned to the spot.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0188.wav|Pushing the shop-door open, he saw Marley finishing his murderous assault.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0189.wav|Lerigo turned for assistance to take the man into custody.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0190.wav|Marley, disturbed, picked up a cigar and parcel from the counter, then ran out, pursued by Lerigo only.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0192.wav|then into Palace Yard, where the waterman of the cab-tank, in obedience to Lerigo's shouts, collared the fugitive.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0193.wav|Escorted by his two captors, Marley was taken back into Parliament Street to the jeweler's shop.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0194.wav|The policemen were now in possession;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0195.wav|two of them supported Cope, who was still alive, although insensible, and Marley was apprehended. The evidence against him was completed|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0196.wav|by his identification by Cope in Westminster Hospital, who survived long enough to make a formal deposition before Mr. Jardine,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0197.wav|the police magistrate, that Marley was the man who had beaten him to death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0198.wav|Marley at his trial was undefended, and the sheriffs offered him counsel; but he declined. The witnesses against him all spoke the truth, he said;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0199.wav|there was no case to make out; why waste money on lawyers for the defense? His demeanor was cool and collected throughout;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0200.wav|he seemed while in Newgate to realize thoroughly that there was no hope for him, and was determined to face his fate bravely.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0201.wav|After sentence, the Newgate officers who had special charge of him noticed that he slept well and ate well, enjoying all his meals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0202.wav|One of them went into his cell just at dinner-time;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0203.wav|the great clock of St. Sepulchre's close by was striking the hour, and Marley, who had his elbows on the table,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0205.wav|On the dread morning he came out to execution quite gaily, and tripped up the stairs to the scaffold.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0206.wav|His captors, it may be added (Lerigo and Allen), were warmly commended by the judge for their courage and activity.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0208.wav|A murderous assault on a police constable, which so nearly ended fatally that the culprit was sentenced to death, although not executed,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0209.wav|was perpetrated in 1852. The case was accompanied with the most shocking brutality.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0210.wav|Cannon, by trade a chimney-sweep, had long been characterized by the bitterest hatred of the police force,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0211.wav|and had been repeatedly sentenced to imprisonment for most desperate and ferocious attacks upon various constables. His last victim was Dwyer,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0212.wav|a fine young officer who had been summoned to take Cannon into custody when the latter was drunk and riotous in front of a public-house.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0213.wav|Dwyer found Cannon bleeding profusely from a wound in the head, and persuaded him to go to a doctor's.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0214.wav|They walked together quietly for some little distance, then Cannon, without the slightest warning,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0215.wav|threw the constable on his back, and violently assaulted him by jumping on his chest and stomach,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0216.wav|and by getting his hand inside Dwyer's stock, with the idea of strangling him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0217.wav|Dwyer managed to overpower his assailant, and got to his feet; but Cannon butted at him with his head, and again threw him to the ground,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0218.wav|after which he kicked his prostrate foe in the most brutal and cowardly manner, and until he was almost senseless, and bruised from head to foot.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0219.wav|Once more Dwyer got to his feet, and managed, by drawing his staff, to keep Cannon at bay until a second constable came to his aid.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0220.wav|All this time not one of a numerous body of bystanders offered to assist the policeman in his extremity.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0221.wav|On the contrary, many of them encouraged the brutal assailant in his savage attack.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0222.wav|To Cannon's infinite surprise, he was indicted for attempt to murder, and not for a simple assault, and found guilty.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0223.wav|The judge, in passing sentence of death, told him he richly deserved the punishment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0224.wav|As Dwyer survived, Cannon escaped the death sentence, which was commuted to penal servitude for life.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0225.wav|A handsome sum was subscribed for the injured constable, who was disabled for life.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0226.wav|Only a few have vied with Cannon in fiendish cruelty and brutality.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0227.wav|One of these was Mobbs, who lived in the Minories,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0228.wav|"generally known by the soubriquet of ""General Haynau,"" a name execrated in England about this time."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0229.wav|Mobbs systematically ill-used his wife for a long space of time, and at last cut her throat.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0230.wav|For this he was executed in front of Newgate in 1833.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0231.wav|Emmanuel Barthelemy again,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0232.wav|the French refugee, was a murderer of the same description, who dispatched his victim with a loaded cane, after which, to secure his escape,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0233.wav|he shot an old soldier who had attempted to detain him. He was convicted and executed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0234.wav|He died impenitent, declaring that he had no belief, and that it was idle to ask forgiveness of God.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0237.wav|I will now pass to grave but less atrocious crimes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0238.wav|In 1850 occurred the first of a series of gigantic frauds,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0239.wav|which followed each other at no long intervals, which had a strong family likeness, and originated all of them to make money easily,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0240.wav|without capital, and at railroad speed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0241.wav|Walter Watts was an inventor, a creator, who struck an entirely new and original line of crime.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0242.wav|Employed as a clerk in the Globe Assurance,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0243.wav|he with unusual quickness of apprehension discovered and promptly turned to account an inexcusably lax system of management,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0244.wav|which offered peculiar chances of profit to an ingenious and unscrupulous man.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0245.wav|It was the custom in this office to make the banker's passbook the basis of the entries in the company's ledgers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0246.wav|Thus, when a payment was made by the company, the amount disbursed was carried to account in the general books from its entry in the passbook,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0247.wav|and without reference to or comparison with the documents in which the payment was claimed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0248.wav|This passbook, when not at the bank, was in the exclusive custody of Watts.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0249.wav|The cheques drawn by the directors also passed through his hands; to him too they came back to be verified and put by,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0250.wav|after they had been cashed by the bank.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0251.wav|In this way Watts had complete control over the whole of the monetary transactions of the company.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0252.wav|He could do what he liked with the passbook, and by its adoption, as described as the basis of all entries,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0253.wav|there was no independent check upon him if he chose to tamper with it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0254.wav|This he did to an enormous extent,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0255.wav|continually altering, erasing, and adding figures to correspond with and cover the abstractions he made of various cheques as they were drawn.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0256.wav|It seems incredible that this passbook, which when produced in court|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0257.wav|was a mass of blots and erasures, should not have created suspicion of foul play either at the bank or at the company's board.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0258.wav|Implicit confidence appears to have been placed in Watts, who was the son of an old and trusted employee, and, moreover, a young man of plausible address.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0259.wav|Watts led two lives.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0260.wav|In the West End he was a man of fashion, with a town house, a house at Brighton, and a cellar full of good wine at both.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0261.wav|He rode a priceless hack in Rotten Row, or drove down to Richmond in a mail phaeton and pair.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0262.wav|He played high, and spent his nights at the club, or in joyous and dissolute company.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0263.wav|When other pleasures palled he took a theatre, and posed as a munificent patron of the dramatic art.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0264.wav|"Under his auspices several ""stars"" appeared on the boards of the Marylebone theatre,"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0265.wav|and later he became manager of the newly rebuilt Olympic at Wych Street.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0266.wav|No one cared too closely to inquire into the sources of wealth. Some said he was a fortunate speculator in stocks,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0267.wav|others that he had had extraordinary luck as a gold-digger. Had his West End and little-informed associates followed him into the city,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0268.wav|whither he was taken every morning in a smart brougham, they would have seen him alight from it in Cornhill,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0269.wav|and walk forward on foot to enter as a humble and unpretending employee the doors of the Globe Assurance office.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0271.wav|Nevertheless, in this position, through the culpable carelessness which left him unfettered, he managed between 1844|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0272.wav|and 1850 to embezzle and apply to his own purposes some £71,000.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0273.wav|The detection of these frauds came while he was still prominently before the world as the lessee of the Olympic.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0274.wav|Rumors were abroad that serious defalcations had been discovered in one of the insurance offices,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0275.wav|but it was long before the public realized that the fraudulent clerk and the great theatrical manager were one and the same person.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0276.wav|Watts's crime was discovered by the secretary of the Globe Company, who came suddenly upon the extensive falsification of the passbook.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0277.wav|An inquiry was at once set on foot, and the frauds were traced to Watts.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0278.wav|The latter, when first taxed with his offense, protested his innocence boldly, and positively denied all knowledge of the affair;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0279.wav|and he had so cleverly destroyed all traces that it was not easy to bring home the charge.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0280.wav|But it was proved that Watts had appropriated one cheque for £1400,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0281.wav|which he had paid into his own bankers, and on this he was committed to Newgate for trial.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0282.wav|There were two counts in the indictment: one for stealing a cheque value £1400, the second for stealing a bit of paper value one penny.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0283.wav|The jury found him guilty of the latter only, with a point of law reserved. This was fully argued before three judges,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0285.wav|and not for the slight offense as it appeared on the record.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0286.wav|The sentence of the court, one of ten years' transportation, struck the prisoner with dismay.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0287.wav|He had been led to suppose that twelve months' imprisonment was the utmost the law could inflict, and he broke down utterly under the unexpected blow.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0288.wav|That same evening he committed suicide in Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0289.wav|The details of the suicide were given at the inquest. Watts had been in ill-health from the time of his first arrest.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0290.wav|In Giltspur Street Compter, where he was first lodged|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0292.wav|His health improved, but was still indifferent when he was brought up for sentence, and he was an occupant of the Newgate infirmary.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0293.wav|He returned from court in a state of gloomy dejection,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0294.wav|and in the middle of the night one of the fellow-prisoners who slept in the same ward noticed that he was not in his bed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0295.wav|This man got up to look for him, and found him hanging from the bars of a neighboring room.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0296.wav|He had made use of a piece of rope cut out from the sacking of his bedstead, and had tied his feet together with a silk pocket-handkerchief.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0297.wav|The prison officers were called, but Watts was quite cold and stiff when he was cut down.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0298.wav|Strange to say, a second suicide occurred in Newgate the same night,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0299.wav|that of a prize-fighter named Donovan, tried the same day, and convicted of manslaughter.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0300.wav|Sentence of death had been recorded against Donovan, who, like Watts, had seemingly been overcome with sudden despair.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0303.wav|Nothing to equal the excitement caused by the forgeries of Robert Ferdinand Pries had been known before in the city of London.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0304.wav|He was a corn merchant who operated largely in grain.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0305.wav|So enormous were his transactions, that they often affected the markets, and caused great fluctuations in prices.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0306.wav|These had been attributed to political action; some thought that the large purchases in foreign grains, effected at losing prices,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0307.wav|were intended by the protectionists to depress the wheat market, and secure the support of the farmers at the forthcoming election;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0308.wav|others, that Napoleon III., but recently proclaimed Emperor of the French, wished to gain the popularity necessary to secure the people.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0309.wav|"Few realized that these mysterious operations were the ""convulsive attempt"" of a ruined and dishonest speculator to sustain his credit."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0310.wav|Pries, although enjoying a high reputation in the city, had long been in a bad way.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0311.wav|His extensive business had been carried on by fraud.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0312.wav|His method was to obtain advances twice over on the same bills of lading or corn warrants. The duplicates were forged.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0313.wav|In this way he obtained vast sums from several firms, and one to which he was indebted upwards of £50,000 subsequently stopped payment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0314.wav|Pries at length was discovered|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0315.wav|through a dishonored cheque for £3000, paid over as an installment of £18,000 owing for an advance on warrants.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0316.wav|Inquiries were instituted when the cheque was protested, which led to the discovery of the forgeries.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0317.wav|Pries was lodged in Newgate, tried at the Old Bailey, and transported for life.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0318.wav|Another set of frauds, which resembled those of Pries in principle, although not in practice, were soon afterwards discovered.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0320.wav|proposed to gain the capital he needed for business purposes by raising money on dock warrants for imported goods which had no real existence.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0321.wav|When such goods arrived they were frequently left at a wharf, paying rent until it suited the importer to remove them.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0322.wav|The dock warrant was issued by the wharfinger as certificate that he held the goods.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0323.wav|The warrant thus represented money, and was often used as such, being endorsed and passed from hand to hand as other negotiable bills.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0324.wav|Cole's plan was to have a wharf of his own, nominally occupied by a creature trading as Maltby and Co.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0325.wav|Goods would be landed at this wharf;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0326.wav|Maltby and Co. would issue warrants on them deliverable to the importer, and the goods were then passed to be stored in neighboring warehouses.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0327.wav|The owners of the latter would then issue a second set of warrants on these goods, in total ignorance of the fact that they were already pledged.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0328.wav|Cole quickly raised money on both sets of warrants. He carried on this game for some time with great success,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0329.wav|and so developed his business that in one year his transactions amounted to a couple of millions of pounds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0330.wav|He had several narrow escapes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0331.wav|"Once a warrant-holder sent down a clerk to view certain goods, and the clerk found that these goods had already a ""stop"" upon them, or were pledged."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0332.wav|"Cole escaped by throwing the blame on a careless partner, and at once removed the ""stop."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0333.wav|Again, some of the duplicate and fictitious warrants were held by a firm which suspended payment, and there was no knowing into whose hands they might fall.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0334.wav|Cole found out where they were, and redeemed them at a heavy outlay, thus obtaining business relations with the firm that held them,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0335.wav|which were soon developed, much to that firm's subsequent anger and regret.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0336.wav|Last of all, the well-known bankers Overend and Gurney, whose own affairs created much excitement some years later,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0337.wav|wishing to verify the value of warrants they held, and sending to Maltby and Co.'s wharf, found out half the truth.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0338.wav|These bankers, wishing for more specific information,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0339.wav|asked Davidson and Gordon, a firm with which Cole was closely allied, whether the warrants meant goods or nothing.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0340.wav|They could not deny that the latter was the truth, and were forthwith stigmatized by Mr. Chapman, Overend and Gurney's representative, as rogues.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0003.wav|A firm which held a lot of warrants suddenly demanded the delivery of the goods they covered.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0004.wav|The goods having no existence, Cole of course could not deliver them.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0005.wav|About this time Davidson and Gordon, the people above-mentioned,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0006.wav|who had fraudulent warrants out of their own to the extent of £150,000, suspended payment and absconded.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0007.wav|This affected Cole's credit, and ugly reports were in circulation charging him with the issue of simulated warrants.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0008.wav|These indeed were out to the value of £367,800.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0009.wav|Cole's difficulties increased more and more; warrant-holders came down upon him demanding to realize their goods.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0010.wav|Cole now suspended payment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0011.wav|Maltby, who had bolted, was pursued and arrested, to end his life miserably by committing suicide in a Newgate cell.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0012.wav|Cole too was apprehended, and in due course tried at the Central Criminal Court.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0013.wav|He was found guilty, and sentenced to the seemingly inadequate punishment of four years' transportation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0014.wav|Davidson and Gordon were also sentenced to imprisonment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0015.wav|A more distressing case stands next on the criminal records --|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0016.wav|the failure and subsequent sentence of the bankers Messrs. Strahan, Paul, and Bates,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0017.wav|for the fraudulent disposal of securities lodged in their hands. This firm was one of the oldest banking establishments in the kingdom,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0018.wav|and dated back to the Commonwealth, when, under the title of Snow and Walton, it carried on business as pawnbrokers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0019.wav|The Strahan of the firm which came to grief was a Snow who changed his name for a fortune of £200,000;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0020.wav|he was a man esteemed and respected in society and the world of finance, incapable as it was thought of a dishonest deed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0021.wav|Sir John Dean Paul had inherited a baronetcy from his father, together with an honored name;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0022.wav|he was himself a prominent member of the Low Church, of austere piety, active in all good works.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0023.wav|Mr. Bates had been confidential managing clerk, and was taken into the firm not alone as a reward for long and faithful service|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0024.wav|but that he might strengthen it by his long experience and known business capacity.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0025.wav|The bank enjoyed an excellent reputation, it had a good connection, and was supposed to be perfectly sound.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0026.wav|Moreover, the partners were sober, steady men, who paid unremitting attention to business.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0027.wav|Yet even so early as the death of the first Sir John Paul,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0028.wav|the bank was insolvent, and instead of starting on a fresh life with a new name, it should then and there have closed its doors.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0029.wav|In December 1851 the balance sheet showed a deficiency of upwards of £70,000.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0030.wav|The bank had been conducted on false principles;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0031.wav|it had assumed enormous responsibilities -- on one side by the ownership of the Mostyn collieries, a valueless property,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0032.wav|and on the other by backing up|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0033.wav|an impecunious and rotten firm of contractors with vast liabilities and pledged to impossible works abroad.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0034.wav|The engagements of the bank on these two heads amounting to nearly half a million of money,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0035.wav|produced immediate embarrassment and financial distress.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0036.wav|The bank was already insolvent,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0037.wav|and the partners had to decide between suspending payment or continuing to hold its head above water by flagitious processes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0038.wav|They chose, unhappily for themselves, the latter alternative.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0039.wav|Money they must have, and money they raised to meet their urgent necessities upon the balances and securities deposited with them by their customers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0040.wav|This borrowing continued, and on such a scale that their paper was soon at a discount,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0041.wav|and the various discount houses would not advance sufficient sums to relieve the necessities of the bank.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0042.wav|Then it was that instead of merely pledging securities, the bank sold them outright, and thus passed the Rubicon of fraud.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0043.wav|This went on for some time, and might never have been discovered had some good stroke of luck provided any of the partners|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0044.wav|with money enough to retrieve the position of the bank. But that passed from bad to worse;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0045.wav|the firm's paper went down further and further in value; an application to the Committee of Bankers for assistance was peremptorily refused,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0046.wav|then came a run on the bank, and it was compelled to stop payment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0047.wav|Its debts amounted to three-quarters of a million, and the dividend it eventually paid was three and twopence in the pound.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0048.wav|But worse than the bankruptcy was the confession made by the partners in the court.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0049.wav|They admitted that they had made away with many of the securities entrusted to their keeping.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0050.wav|Following this, warrants were issued for their arrest,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0051.wav|the specific charge being the unlawful negotiation of Danish bonds and other shares belonging to the Rev. Dr. Griffiths of Rochester|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0052.wav|to the value of £20,000.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0053.wav|Bates was at once captured in Norfolk Street, Strand.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0054.wav|Police officers went down at night to Nutfield, near Reigate, and arrested Sir John Paul, but allowed the prisoner to sleep there.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0055.wav|Next morning they only just saved the train to town, and left Sir John behind on the platform, but he subsequently surrendered himself.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0056.wav|Mr. Strahan was arrested at a friend's house in Bryanston Square.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0057.wav|All three were tried at the Central Criminal Court, and sentenced to fourteen years' transportation, passing some time in Newgate en route.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0058.wav|Bates, the least guilty, was pardoned in 1858.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0059.wav|Two cases of extensive embezzlement which were discovered almost simultaneously, those of Robson and Redpath,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0060.wav|will long be remembered both within and without the commercial world.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0061.wav|They both reproduced many of the features of the case of Watts, already described,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0062.wav|but in neither did the sums misappropriated reach quite the same high figure.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0063.wav|But neither Robson nor Redpath would have been able to pursue their fraudulent designs with success had they not, like Watts,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0064.wav|been afforded peculiar facilities by the slackness of system and the want of methodical administration in the concerns by which they were employed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0065.wav|Robson was of humble origin, but he was well educated, and he had some literary abilities.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0066.wav|His proclivities were theatrical, and he was the author of several plays,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0067.wav|one at least of which, 'Love and Loyalty,' with Wallack in a leading part, achieved a certain success.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0068.wav|He began life as a law-writer, earning thereby some fifteen or eighteen shillings a week;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0069.wav|but the firm he served got him a situation as clerk in the office of the Great Northern Railway,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0070.wav|whence he passed to a better position under the Crystal Palace Company.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0071.wav|He now married, although his salary was only a pound a week; but he soon got on.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0072.wav|He had a pleasant address, showed good business aptitudes, and quickly acquired the approval of his superiors.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0073.wav|Within a year he was advanced to the post of chief clerk in the transfer department, at a salary of £150 a year.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0074.wav|His immediate chief was a Mr. Fasson, upon whose confidence he gained so rapidly, through his activity, industry, and engaging manners,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0075.wav|that ere long the whole management of the transfer department was entrusted to him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0076.wav|Some time elapsed before Robson succumbed to temptation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0077.wav|He was not the first man of loose morality and expensive tastes|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0078.wav|who preferred to risk his future reputation and liberty to the present discomfort of living upon narrow means.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0079.wav|The temptation was all the greater because the chances of successful fraud lay ready to hand.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0080.wav|Shares in the company were represented by certificates, which often enough never left the company's, or more exactly Robson's, hands.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0081.wav|He conceived the idea of transferring shares, bogus shares from a person who held none, to any one who would buy them in the open market.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0082.wav|He took it for granted that the certificates representing these bogus shares, and which practically did not exist, would never be called for.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0083.wav|This ingenious method of raising funds he adopted and carried on without detection,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0084.wav|till the defalcations from fraudulent transfers and fraudulent issues combined amounted to £27,000.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0085.wav|With the proceeds of these flagitious frauds Robson feasted and made merry.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0086.wav|He kept open house at Kilburn Priory;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0087.wav|"entertained literary, artistic, and dramatic celebrities; had a smart ""turn out,"" attended all the race-meetings, and dressed in the latest fashion."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0088.wav|To his wife, poor soul, he made no pretense of fidelity, and she enjoyed only so much of his company as was necessarily spent|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0089.wav|in receiving guests at home, or could be spared from two rival establishments in other parts of the town.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0090.wav|To account for his revenues he pretended to have been very lucky on the Stock Exchange, which was at one time true to a limited extent,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0091.wav|and to have succeeded in other speculations.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0092.wav|When his friends asked why he, a wealthy man of independent means, continued to slave on as a clerk on a pittance,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0093.wav|he replied gaily that his regular work at the Crystal Palace office was useful as a sort of discipline, and kept him steady.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0094.wav|All this time his position was one of extreme insecurity. He was standing over a mine which at any moment might explode.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0095.wav|The blow fell suddenly, and when least expected. One morning Mr. Fasson asked casually for certain certificates,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0096.wav|whether representing real or fictitious shares does not appear; but they were certificates connected in some way with Robson's long practiced frauds|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0097.wav|and he could not produce them. His chief asked sternly where they were.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0098.wav|Robson said they were at Kilburn Priory.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0099.wav|Let us go to Kilburn for them together, said Mr. Fasson, growing suspicious.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0100.wav|They drove there, and Robson on arrival did the honors of his house, rang for lunch to gain time,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0101.wav|but at Mr. Fasson's pressing demands went upstairs to fetch the certificates.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0102.wav|He came back to explain that he had mislaid them.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0103.wav|Mr. Fasson, more and more ill at ease, would not accept this subterfuge, and declared they must be found.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0104.wav|Robson again left him, but only to gather together hastily all the money and valuables on which he could lay his hands, with which he left the house.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0105.wav|Mr. Fasson waited and waited for his subordinate to re-appear, and at last discovered his flight.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0106.wav|A reward was forthwith offered for Robson's apprehension.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0107.wav|Meanwhile the absconding clerk had coolly driven to a favorite dining-place in the West End,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0108.wav|where a fish curry and a brace of partridges were set before him,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0109.wav|and he discussed the latter with appetite, but begged that they would never give him curry again, as he did not like it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0110.wav|After dinner he went into hiding for a day or two,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0111.wav|then, accompanied by a lady, not Mrs. Robson, he took steamer and started for Copenhagen.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0112.wav|But the continental police had been warned to look out for him, and two Danish inspectors got upon his track,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0113.wav|followed him over to Sweden, and arrested him at Helsingfors.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0114.wav|Thence he was transferred to Copenhagen and surrendered in due course to a London police officer.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0115.wav|Little more remains to be said about Robson. He appears to have accepted his position, and to have at once resigned himself to his fate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0116.wav|"When brought to trial he took matters very coolly, and at first pleaded ""Not Guilty,"" but subsequently withdrew the plea."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0117.wav|Sergeant Ballantine, who prosecuted,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0118.wav|"paid him the compliment of describing him as ""a young man of great intelligence, considerable powers of mind,"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0119.wav|"and possessed of an education very much beyond the rank of life to which he originally belonged."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0120.wav|Robson was found guilty, and sentenced to two terms of transportation, one for twenty and one for fourteen years.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0121.wav|Newgate officers who remember Robson still describe him as a fine young man, who behaved well as a prisoner,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0122.wav|but who had all the appearance of a careless, thoughtless, happy-go-lucky fellow.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0123.wav|In many respects the embezzlement of which Leopold Redpath was guilty closely resembled that of Robson,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0124.wav|but it was based upon more extended and audacious forgeries.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0125.wav|Redpath's crime arose from his peculiar and independent position as registrar of stock of the Great Northern Railway Company.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0126.wav|This offered him great facilities for the creation of artificial stock, its sale from a fictitious holder, and transfer to himself.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0127.wav|"All the signatures in the transfer were forged. Not only did he thus transfer and realize ""bogus"" stock"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0128.wav|but he bought bona fide amounts, and increased their value by altering the figures,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0129.wav|by inserting say 1 before 500, and thus making it|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0130.wav|fifteen hundred pounds, which larger amount was duly carried to his credit on the register, and entered upon the certificates of transfer.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0131.wav|By these means Redpath misappropriated vast sums during a period extending over ten years.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0132.wav|The total amount was never exactly made out, but the false stock created and issued by him was estimated at two hundred twenty thousand pounds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0133.wav|Even when the bubble burst Redpath, who had lived at the rate of twenty thousand a year,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0134.wav|had assets in the shape of land, house, furniture, pictures, and objets d'art to the value of £50,000.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0135.wav|He began in a very small way.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0136.wav|First a lawyer's clerk, he then got an appointment in the Peninsular and Oriental Company's office;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0137.wav|afterwards he set up as an insurance broker on his own account, but presently failed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0138.wav|His fault was generosity,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0139.wav|an open-handed, unthinking charity which gave freely to the poor and needy the money which belonged to his creditors.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0140.wav|After his bankruptcy he obtained a place as clerk in the Great Northern Railway office,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0141.wav|from which he rose to be assistant registrar, with the special duties of transferring shares.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0142.wav|He soon proved his ability, and by unremitting attention mastered the whole work of the office.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0143.wav|Later on he became registrar, and in this more independent position|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0144.wav|developed to a colossal extent the frauds he had already practiced as a subordinate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0145.wav|Now he launched out into great expenditure, took a house in Chester Terrace, and became known as a Maecenas and patron of the arts.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0146.wav|He had a nice taste in bric-à-brac, and was considered a good judge of pictures.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0147.wav|Leading social and artistic personages were to be met with at his house, and his hospitality was far famed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0148.wav|The choicest wines, the finest fruits,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0149.wav|peas at ten shillings a quart, five-guinea pines, and early asparagus were to be found on his table.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0150.wav|But his chief extravagance, his favorite folly, was the exercise of an ostentatious benevolence.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0151.wav|The philanthropy he had displayed in a small way when less prosperous became now a passion.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0152.wav|His name headed every subscription list; his purse was always open.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0153.wav|Not content with giving where assistance was solicited, he himself sought out deserving cases and personally afforded relief.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0154.wav|When the crash came there were pensioners and other recipients of his bounty who could not believe|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0155.wav|that so good a man had really been for years a swindler and a rogue.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0156.wav|Down at Weybridge, where he had a country place, his name was long remembered with gratitude by the poor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0157.wav|During the days of his prosperity he was a governor of Christ's Hospital,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0158.wav|of the St. Ann's Society, and one of the supporters and managers of the Patriotic Fund.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0159.wav|In his person he was neat and fastidious;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0160.wav|he patronized the best tailors, and had a fashionable coiffeur from Hanover Square daily to curl his hair.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0161.wav|There was something dramatic in Redpath's detection|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0162.wav|Just after Robson's frauds had agitated the minds of all directors of companies, the chairman of the Great Northern (Mr. Denison)|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0163.wav|was standing at a railway station talking to a certain well-known peer of the realm.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0164.wav|Redpath passed and lifted his hat to his chairman; the latter acknowledged the salute.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0165.wav|But the peer rushed forward and shook Redpath warmly by the hand.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0166.wav|"What do you know of our clerk? asked Mr. Denison of his lordship. ""Only that he is a capital fellow, who gives the best dinners and balls in town."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0167.wav|Redpath had industriously circulated reports that he had prospered greatly in speculation;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0168.wav|but the chairman of the Great Northern could not realize that a clerk of the company could honestly be in the possession of unlimited wealth.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0169.wav|It was at once decided at the board to make a thorough examination of all his books.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0170.wav|Redpath was called in and informed of the intended investigation. He tried to stave off the evil hour by declaring that everything was perfectly right;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0171.wav|but finding he could not escape, he said he would resign his post, and leaving the boardroom, disappeared.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0172.wav|The inquiry soon revealed the colossal character of the frauds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0173.wav|Warrants were issued for Redpath's arrest, but he had flown to Paris.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0174.wav|Thither police officers followed, only to find that he had returned to London.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0175.wav|A further search discovered him at breakfast at a small house in the New Road.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0176.wav|He was arrested, examined before a police magistrate, and committed to Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0177.wav|Great excitement prevailed in the city and the West End when Redpath's defalcations were made public.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0178.wav|The Stock Market was greatly affected, and society, more especially that which frequents Exeter Hall, was convulsed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0179.wav|The Central Criminal Court, when the trial came on,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0180.wav|was densely crowded, and many curious eyes were turned upon the somewhat remarkable man who occupied the dock.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0181.wav|He is described by a contemporary account as a fresh-looking man of forty years of age, slightly bald, inclined to embonpoint,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0182.wav|and thoroughly embodying the idea of English respectability.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0183.wav|"His manner was generally self-possessed, but his face was marked with ""uneasy earnestness,"""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0184.wav|and he looked about him with wayward, furtive glances.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0185.wav|When the jury found a verdict of guilty he remained unmoved. He listened without emotion to the judge's well-merited censures,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0186.wav|and received his sentence of transportation for life without much surprise.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0187.wav|Redpath passed away into the outer darkness of a penal colony, where he was still living a year or two back|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0188.wav|But his name lingers still in this country as that of the first swindler of his time,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0189.wav|and the prototype of a class not uncommon in our later days|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0190.wav|that of dishonest rogues who assume piety and philanthropy as a cloak for their misdeeds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0191.wav|In Newgate Redpath is remembered by the prison officer as a difficult man to deal with.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0192.wav|From the moment of his reception he gave himself great airs, as a martyr and a man heavily wronged.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0193.wav|By-and-by, when escape seemed hopeless, and after sentence, he suddenly degenerated into the lowest stamp of criminal,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0194.wav|and behaved so as to justify a belief that he had been a jail-bird all his life.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0195.wav|It has been already remarked in these pages that with changed social conditions came a great change in the character of crimes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0196.wav|"Highway robberies, for instance, had disappeared, if we except the spasmodic and severely repressed outbreak of ""garotting,"""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0197.wav|which at one time spread terror throughout London. Thieves preferred now to use ingenuity rather than brute force.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0198.wav|It was no longer possible to stop a coach or carriage, or rob the postman who carried the mail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0199.wav|The improved methods of locomotion had put a stop to these depredations. People traveled in company, as a rule;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0200.wav|only when single and unprotected were they in any danger of attack, and that but rarely.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0201.wav|There were still big prizes, however, to tempt the daring, and none appealed more to the thievish instinct than the custom of transmitting gold by rail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0202.wav|The precious metal was sent from place to place carefully locked up and guarded, no doubt;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0203.wav|but were the precautions too minute, the vigilance too close to be eluded or overcome?|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0204.wav|This was the question which presented itself to the fertile brain of one Pierce,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0205.wav|"who had been concerned in various ""jobs"" of a dishonest character, and who for the moment was a clerk in a betting office."|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0209.wav|Burgess detailed the whole system of transmission.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0210.wav|The gold, packed in an iron-bound box, was securely lodged in safes locked with patent Chubbs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0211.wav|Each safe had three sets of double keys, all held by confidential servants of the company.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0212.wav|One pair was with the traffic superintendent in London, another with an official in Folkestone,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0215.wav|The safes while on the line en route between London and Folkestone were in the guard's van.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0216.wav|This was an important step, and they might easily be robbed some day when Burgess was the guard, provided only that they could be opened.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0217.wav|The next step was to get impressions and fabricate false keys.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0218.wav|A new accomplice was now needed within the company's establishment, and Pierce looked about long before he found the right person.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0273.wav|But Saward's operations were mainly directed to the fabrication and uttering of forged cheques.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0274.wav|His method was comprehensive and deeply laid.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0275.wav|Burglars brought him the cheques they stole from houses, thieves what they got in pocketbooks.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0276.wav|Cheques blank and canceled were his stock-in-trade. The former he filled up by exact imitation of the latter, signature and all.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0277.wav|When he could get nothing but the blank cheque, he set in motion all sorts of schemes for obtaining signatures, such as|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0281.wav|Saward's method of negotiating the cheques was equally well planned.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0282.wav|Like his great predecessor Old Patch, he never went to a bank himself, nor did any of his accomplices.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0283.wav|The bearer of the cheque was always innocent and ignorant of the fraudulent nature of the document he presented.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0284.wav|In order to obtain messengers of this sort, Saward answered advertisements of persons seeking employment,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0285.wav|and when these presented themselves, entrusted them as a beginning with the duty of cashing cheques.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0286.wav|A confederate followed the emissary closely,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0287.wav|not only to ensure fair play and the surrender of the proceeds if the cheque was cashed, but to give timely notice if it was not,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0288.wav|so that Saward and the rest might make themselves scarce.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0289.wav|As each transaction was carried out from a different address, and a different messenger always employed,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0290.wav|the forgers always escaped detection. But fate overtook two of the gang,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0291.wav|partly through their own carelessness, when transferring their operations to Yarmouth.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0292.wav|One named Hardwicke assumed the name of Ralph, and, to obtain commercial credit in Yarmouth, paid in £250 to a Yarmouth bank|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0294.wav|He forgot to add that it was to be placed to Ralph's credit, and when he called as Ralph,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0295.wav|he was told it was only at Mr. Whitney's disposal, and that it could be paid to no one else.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0297.wav|and that clever schemer sent an elaborate letter of instructions how to ask for the money.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0299.wav|and the circumstances were deemed sufficiently suspicious to warrant the arrest of the gentlemen at Yarmouth on a charge of forgery and conspiracy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0300.wav|Saward's letter to Hardwicke fell into the hands of the police and compromised him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0301.wav|While Hardwicke and Atwell were in Newgate awaiting trial, active search was made for Saward,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0302.wav|who was at length taken in a coffee-shop near Oxford Street, under the name of Hopkins. He resisted at first, and denied his identity,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0303.wav|but on being searched, two blank cheques of the London and Westminster Bank were found in his pocket.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0039.wav|Williams surveyed these formidable obstacles to evasion, and calmly proceeded to surmount them.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0040.wav|His first task was to gain the top of the cistern; this he effected by keeping his back to one side of the angle,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0041.wav|and working with his hands behind him, while he used his bare feet like claws upon the other side of the wall angle.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0042.wav|The condition of the stone surface just mentioned assisted him in this, and he managed to get beyond the cistern to the railing below the chevaux-de-frise.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0043.wav|The least slip now would have been fatal to him. But he could not thrust his body in through the narrow space left by the chevaux-de-frise,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0044.wav|and was compelled to work along the railing round three-quarters of the square of the yard,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0045.wav|and at length reached a point opposite the top of the building containing the condemned wards. This had been a perilous and painful task;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0046.wav|the spikes of the railing penetrated his flesh and made progression slow and difficult.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0047.wav|But the worst part of the business was to jump from this irksome foothold of the iron grating on to the top of the building just mentioned,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0048.wav|a distance of eight or nine feet.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0049.wav|He had here completed his ascent.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0050.wav|His next job was to descend outside Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0051.wav|Clambering along the roof,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0052.wav|he passed to the top of the ordinary's residence, hoping to find an open sky-light by which he might enter and so work downstairs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0053.wav|If the worst came to the worst, he intended to have gone down some chimney, as he had often done before in the way of business.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0054.wav|But he did not like the risk of entering a room by the fireplace, and the chances of detection it offered.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0055.wav|He traversed vainly all the roofs in Newgate Street,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0056.wav|running a great risk of discovery as he passed by a lot of workmen at Tyler's manufactory in Warwick Square, which had formerly been the College of Physicians.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0057.wav|As his coat was an encumbrance, he left it on the top of the third house in Newgate Street, and thus in shirt-sleeves, barefoot and bareheaded,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0058.wav|he worked along to the roofs in Warwick Lane.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0059.wav|Here he came upon a woman on the leads hanging out clothes to dry.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0060.wav|Williams concealed himself behind a chimney till she had re-entered her garret,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0061.wav|and then following her down a step ladder into the house, told his story, appealed to and won her compassion.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0062.wav|She suffered him to pass downstairs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0063.wav|Below he met another woman and a girl, both of whom were terrified at his appearance, but|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0064.wav|when he explained that he was running away from the gallows they left him the road clear.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0065.wav|To walk out into the street was an easy affair, and he was now free, with one and fourpence in his pocket and a shirt and trousers for all his clothing.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0067.wav|he tramped across London Bridge to Wandsworth, where he refreshed himself with a pint of strong ale, the first sustenance he had taken since his escape,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0068.wav|and continued his march to Kingston, where he slept soundly under a hedge till next morning.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0069.wav|Entering a town, he obtained employment at once as a chimney-sweep|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0070.wav|"from a widow woman, who gave him ""bub and grub,"" or food and one-and-sixpence, for every nine days' work."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0071.wav|Dissatisfied with this remuneration, he again took to the road, and tramped into Hampshire,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0072.wav|where he presently committed a burglary at Lymington, was caught, and lodged in Winchester Jail.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0074.wav|The success, although very short-lived, which attended him, no doubt inspired other inmates of Newgate to follow his example.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0075.wav|It was for some time after this a constant practice to go up the chimneys in the hopes of escaping by the flue.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0076.wav|Even then, however, irons across barred the ascent after a certain distance, and in no one case did a fugitive get clear away.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0077.wav|A man named Lears, under sentence of transportation for an attempt at murder on board ship, got up part of the way,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0078.wav|but had to come down again covered with soot and filth just as the officers entered the ward.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0079.wav|Lears was rewarded by being obliged to wear cross irons on his legs, a punishment rarely inflicted in Newgate,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0080.wav|and probably one of the few cases of a recurrence, but under proper safeguards and limitations, to the old system of chains.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0081.wav|On another occasion Mr. Cope the governor came in and missed a man.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0082.wav|The ward was one short of its number. What had become of the fellow?|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0084.wav|the fugitive, uncomfortably ensconced in the flue, came down of his own accord, like Colonel Colt's raccoon.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0085.wav|After this great iron guards, just as are to be seen in lunatic asylums,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0087.wav|Among the escapes still remembered was one in 1849, accomplished by a man who had been employed|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0089.wav|He was engaged in whitewashing and cleaning; the officer who had him in charge left him on the stairs leading to the gallery.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0090.wav|Taking advantage of being unobserved, he got out through the roof on to the leads, and traveled along them towards No. 1, Newgate Street.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0091.wav|This was a public-house.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0092.wav|He stepped in at a garret window, coolly walked downstairs, and entered the bar.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0093.wav|They asked him how he had cut his hand, which was bleeding, and he said he had done it while working up on the roof.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0094.wav|No further notice was taken of him; no one seemingly suspected that he was a prisoner, and he was suffered to walk off without let or hindrance.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0095.wav|In 1853 three men escaped in company from one of the wards in the middle yard.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0096.wav|They were penal servitude men, their names Bell, Brown, and Barry, and they were awaiting transfer to Leicester,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0097.wav|which with Wakefield was utilized as a receptacle for convicts not going to Western Australia,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0098.wav|or any of the new establishments at home, at Portland, Dartmoor, or elsewhere.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0099.wav|These men managed to cut a hole in the ceiling of the ward near the iron cage on the landing, and so got access to the roof.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0100.wav|At that time rope mats were still used as beds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0101.wav|One of the three, shamming ill, remained all day in his ward, where he employed himself unraveling the rope from the sleeping-mats.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0102.wav|By evening he manufactured a good long length,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0103.wav|and after all was quiet the three got on to the roof through the hole, and so on to Tyler's manufactory close by,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0104.wav|whence they let themselves down into the street by the rope.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0105.wav|These men were all in prison dress at the time of their escape, but one of their number, Bell, sent back his clothes a few days later by parcel's delivery,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0106.wav|with a civil note to the governor, saying he had no further use for them. All three fugitives were recaptured,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0107.wav|Brown almost at once; then Barry, who was taken at the East End in a public-house where he had arranged to meet a pal.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0108.wav|The Newgate officers obtained information of this, and went to the spot, where they effected the capture,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0109.wav|but not till they had had an exciting chase down the street.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0110.wav|The third, Bell, remained longest at large. He too was run into at a lodging in the Kingsland Road.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0111.wav|The officers dropped on to him while he was still in bed, but as they came upstairs he jumped up and hid in a cupboard.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0112.wav|"All three after recapture passed on, as originally intended, to Leicester, where they did their ""bit"" and were released;"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0113.wav|but only to be taken soon afterwards for a fresh offense, and again pass through Newgate with sentences of penal servitude.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0114.wav|A later case was still more remarkable, as it was effected after the alteration of the prison and its reconstruction on the newest lines.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0115.wav|A sailor, Krapps by name, occupied one of the upper cells in the new block.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0116.wav|The doors, through incomplete knowledge of prison needs, were not, as now, sheeted with iron.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0117.wav|The prisoner had nothing to deal with but wooden panels, and by dint of cutting and chopping he got both the lower panels out.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0118.wav|Through the aperture he crept out on to the landing at the dead of night, and so down into the central space of the building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0119.wav|Under superior orders all the doors and gates of this block were left open at night, to allow the night watchman to pass freely to all parts.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0120.wav|This was considered safer than intrusting him with keys.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0121.wav|Krapps walked at once into the yard and across to the female side, where he found some of the washing still hanging out to dry.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0122.wav|He made a strong rope with several of the sheets; then, returning to the male yard,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0123.wav|got hold of the step ladder used in lighting the gas, and which under our more careful supervision would have been, as now-a-days, chained up.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0124.wav|Cutting the cord which fastened the two legs of the step ladder, he opened them out and made one long length;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0125.wav|with this, placed against the wall near the chevaux-de-frise, he made an escalade.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0126.wav|The top of the wall was gained without difficulty.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0127.wav|Along this Krapps crawled, and then dropped down on to the cook-house.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0128.wav|He now put in requisition the rope made of the sheets, and with its help lowered himself into the street.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0129.wav|Down below were market-carts waiting for daylight, and among them Krapps found a refuge and friends.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0130.wav|The first intimation of his escape was afforded by the police, who informed the prison authorities next day that a rope was hanging down from the cook-house roof.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0131.wav|Nothing more was heard of Krapps. The curious thing in his case was that his offense was a trifling one;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0132.wav|he was still untried, but would almost certainly have escaped with a minor penalty, say of three or four months' imprisonment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0133.wav|There is, however, no explanation of the motives which prompt prisoners to attempt escapes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0134.wav|Cases well authenticated have been known of men who had all but completed their sentences, and for whom the prison gates would open within a few days,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0139.wav|The last escape from Newgate was only three years ago, and occurred just before the final closing of the prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0140.wav|No report of it was made public, as the man was almost immediately recaptured.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0141.wav|He was at work under the supervision of the artisan warder of the prison,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0142.wav|who permitted him to go up on to the roof of the old wards, in order to throw water for flushing purposes down a shoot.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0143.wav|He was out of sight while so employed, and remained so long absent that the warder, becoming uneasy, went in search of him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0144.wav|He had disappeared.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0145.wav|Encouraged by the shouts and signals of some workmen employed on a building outside, the prisoner made one of the most marvellous jumps on record,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0147.wav|Then he ran along the coping of the wall towards its angle with Tyler's manufactory, and dropped down on to the gridiron below.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0148.wav|This was not strong enough to carry him, and he fell through.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0175.wav|I may be permitted to digress for a moment to give a few particulars concerning the last officially appointed hangman of the city of London.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0176.wav|After Calcraft's resignation no successor was really appointed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0177.wav|Marwood, whose name is so familiar with the present generation,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0178.wav|had no official status, and was merely an operator selected by the Corporation, and who, on the strength of it,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0179.wav|contracted with sheriffs and conveners to work by the job.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0180.wav|But Calcraft regularly succeeded Foxen, who followed Botting, and Dennis, the actor in the 1780 riots.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0181.wav|Calcraft was born at Baddow, in Essex, in 1800;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0182.wav|he was a shoemaker by trade, and settled in London after his marriage in 1825.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0183.wav|The story goes, that about 1828|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0184.wav|his attention was drawn early one morning to a man who leant against a lamp-post in Finsbury Square, coughing violently.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0185.wav|Calcraft, who, in spite of the dreadful calling he subsequently followed, was always reputed a kindly man,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0186.wav|invited the man with the cough to enter a neighboring house and try a little peppermint for it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0187.wav|The other accepted, and they got into conversation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0188.wav|He told Calcraft that he was Foxen the executioner, and that he was that moment on his way to Newgate to hang a man,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0189.wav|but that his cough was getting so much the master of him that he feared he would not be able to carry on his duties much longer.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0190.wav|I have no idea who the sheriffs will get to do the work after me, said Foxen, adding that his assistant, Tom Cheshire,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0191.wav|was given to drink, and not to be trusted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0192.wav|I think I could do that sort of job, said Calcraft, on the spur of the moment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0193.wav|Foxen asked him his name and address, and went away.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0194.wav|Calcraft thought no more of what had occurred till the next sessions at the Old Bailey, when the sheriffs sent for him,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0195.wav|and offered him the post of executioner for the city of London and Middlesex.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0196.wav|He accepted, having at first Tom Cheshire as his assistant, then for a time, when Cheshire was dismissed for drunkenness, a man named Osborne.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0199.wav|It was customary to make the executioner take the Bible in his hand, and swear solemnly that he would dispatch every criminal condemned to die,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0205.wav|he received a retaining fee of £5, 5 shillings, with the usual guinea for each job;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0206.wav|he was also at liberty to engage himself in the country, where he demanded and was paid £10 on each occasion.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0207.wav|It was not always easy to get a hangman so cheap, as I have already indicated on a previous page.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0208.wav|The onus and responsibility of carrying out the sentence is personal to the sheriff. A good story is told illustrating this.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0209.wav|Some wags in Scotland seized Calcraft and kept him in durance the night before the execution.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0210.wav|Meanwhile the convener or sheriff was in despair, expecting that, failing the executioner, he would have to do the job himself.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0211.wav|But, fortunately for him, just at the last moment Calcraft was set free.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0212.wav|"Calcraft's salary was more than the proverbial ""thirteenpence halfpenny -- hangman's wages."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0213.wav|The origin of this expression dates, it is said, from the time when the Scottish mark,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0214.wav|a silver coin bearing the same relation to the Scottish pound that an English shilling does to an English pound, was made to pass current in England.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0215.wav|The mark was valued at thirteenpence halfpenny, or rather more than the shilling, which from time immemorial had been the hangman's wages.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0216.wav|That very ancient perquisite the convict's clothes was never claimed by Calcraft, and it may be doubted whether he was entitled to it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0217.wav|On one particular occasion, however, he got them. A gentleman whose sins brought him to the gallows at Maidstone|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0218.wav|wished to do Calcraft a good turn, and sent to his London tailor for a complete new suit, in which he appeared at his execution.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0219.wav|He expressly bequeathed them to Calcraft, who was graciously pleased to accept them.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0220.wav|On another occasion an importunate person begged Calcraft eagerly to claim his right to the clothes, and give them to him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0221.wav|Calcraft consented, got and bestowed the clothes, only to find that the person he had obliged exhibited them publicly.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0222.wav|It may be added that of late years the clothes in which a convict has suffered are invariably burnt.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0223.wav|Capital convicts go to the gallows in their own clothing, and not in prison dress, unless the former is quite unfit to be worn.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0224.wav|Calcraft shared the odium which his office, not strangely, has always inspired. But he was admitted into the jail,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0303.wav|It was preposterous to claim for such a scene as this that it conveyed any great moral lesson, or had any deterring influence.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0304.wav|Numbers of humane and thoughtful persons had long been convinced of this.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0305.wav|Already the urgent necessity for abolishing public executions had been brought before the House of Commons by Mr. Hibbert,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0306.wav|and the question, as part of the whole subject of capital punishment, had been referred to a royal commission in January 1864.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0307.wav|Full evidence was taken on all points, and on that regarding public executions there was a great preponderance of opinion towards their abolition,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0308.wav|yet the witnesses were not unanimous.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0309.wav|Some of the judges would have retained the public spectacle; the ordinary of Newgate was not certain that public executions were not the best.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0310.wav|Another distinguished witness feared|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0311.wav|that any secrecy in the treatment of the condemned would invest them with a new and greater interest, which was much to be deprecated.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0312.wav|Foreign witnesses, too, were in favor of publicity.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0313.wav|On the other hand, Lords Cranworth and Wensleydale recommended private executions; so did Mr. Spencer Walpole, M.P.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0314.wav|Sir George Grey thought there was a growing feeling in favor of executions within the prison precincts.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0315.wav|Colonel (now Sir Edmund) Henderson was strongly in favor of them,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0316.wav|based on his experience of them in Western Australia. He not only thought them likely to be more deterrent,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0317.wav|but believed that a public ceremony destroyed the whole value of an execution.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0318.wav|Other officials, great lawyers, governors of prisons, and chaplains supported this view.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0319.wav|The only doubts expressed were as to the sufficiency of the safeguards, as to the certainty of death and its subsequent publication.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0320.wav|But these, it was thought, might be provided by the admission of the press and the holding of a coroner's inquest.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0321.wav|Duly impressed with the weight of evidence in favor of abolition,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0322.wav|the commission recommended that death sentences should be carried out within the jail, under such regulations as might be considered necessary|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0323.wav|to prevent abuse, and satisfy the public that the law had been complied with.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0324.wav|But it is curious to note that there were several dissentients among the commissioners to this paragraph of the report.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0325.wav|The judge of the Admiralty Court, the Right Hon. Stephen Lushington, the Right Hon. James Moncrieff,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0327.wav|declared that they were not prepared to agree to the resolution respecting private executions.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0328.wav|Nevertheless, in the very next session|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0329.wav|a bill was introduced by Mr. Hibbert, M.P., and accepted by the Government, providing for the future carrying out of executions within prisons.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0330.wav|It was read for the first time in March 1866, but did not become law till 1868.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0331.wav|The last public execution in front of Newgate was that of the Fenian Michael Barrett,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0332.wav|who was convicted of complicity in the Clerkenwell explosion, intended to effect the release of Burke and Casey|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0333.wav|from Clerkenwell prison, by which many persons lost their lives.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0334.wav|Unusual precautions were taken upon this occasion, as some fresh outrage was apprehended.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0335.wav|There was no interference with the crowd, which collected as usual, although not to the customary extent.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0336.wav|But Newgate and its neighborhood was carefully held by the police, both city and metropolitan.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0337.wav|In the houses opposite the prison numbers of detectives mixed with the spectators;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0338.wav|inside the jail was Colonel Frazer, the chief commissioner of the city police, and at no great distance, although in the background,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0339.wav|troops were held in readiness to act if required. Everything passed off quite quietly, however,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0340.wav|and Calcraft, who had been threatened with summary retribution if he executed Barrett, carried out the sentence without mishap.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0341.wav|The sufferer was stolid and reticent to the last.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0342.wav|The first private execution under the new law took place within the precincts of Maidstone Jail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0343.wav|The sufferer was a porter on the London, Chatham, and Dover railway, sentenced to death for shooting the station-master at Dover.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0344.wav|The ceremony, which was witnessed by only a few officials and representatives of the press, was performed with the utmost decency and decorum.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0346.wav|a fact duly advertised as completed by the hoisting of the black flag over the jail,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0347.wav|had undoubtedly a solemn, impressive effect upon those outside.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0348.wav|The same was realized in the first private execution within Newgate,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0349.wav|that of Alexander Mackay, who murdered his mistress at Norton Folgate by beating her with a rolling-pin and furnace-rake,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0350.wav|and who expiated his crime on the 8th September, 1868.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0351.wav|A more marked change from the old scene can hardly be conceived. Instead of the roar of the brutalized crowd,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0352.wav|the officials spoke in whispers; there was but little moving to and fro.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0353.wav|Almost absolute silence prevailed until the great bell began to toll its deep note, and broke the stillness with its regular and monotonous clangour,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0354.wav|and the ordinary, in a voice trembling with emotion, read the burial service aloud.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0355.wav|Mackay's fortitude, which had been great,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0356.wav|broke down at the supreme moment before the horror of the stillness, the awful impressiveness of the scene in which he was the principal actor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0357.wav|No time was lost in carrying out the dread ceremony; but it was not completed without some of the officials turning sick, and the moment it was over,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0358.wav|all who could were glad to escape from the last act of the ghastly drama at which they had assisted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0359.wav|Private executions at their first introduction were not popular with the Newgate officials, and for intelligible reasons.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0360.wav|The change added greatly to the responsibilities of the governor and his subordinates. Hitherto the public had seemed to assist at the ceremony;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0361.wav|the moment too that the condemned man had passed through the debtors' door on to the scaffold the prison had done with him,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0362.wav|and the great outside world shared in the completion of the sacrifice.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0363.wav|This feeling was the stronger because|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0364.wav|all the ghastly paraphernalia, the gallows itself and the process of erecting and removing it, rested with the city architect, and not with the prison officials.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0365.wav|Moreover, after the execution, under the old system, the latter had only to receive the body for burial after it had been cut down by the hangman,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0366.wav|and placed decently in a shell by the workmen who removed the gallows.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0367.wav|Under the new system the whole of the arrangements from first to last fell upon the officers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0368.wav|It was they who formed the chief part of the small select group of spectators;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0369.wav|upon them devolved the painful duty of cutting down the body and preparing for the inquest.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0370.wav|All that the hangman, whoever he may be, does under the new regime is to unhook the halter and remove the pinioning straps.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0371.wav|The interment in a shell filled with quicklime in the passage-way leading to the Old Bailey is also a part of the duty of the prison officials.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0373.wav|and for the greater security of prisoners it is roofed in with iron bars which gives it, at least overhead, the aspect of a huge cage.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0374.wav|Underfoot and upon the walls roughly cut into the stones, are single initial letters, the brief epitaphs of those who lie below.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0375.wav|As this burial-ground leads to the adjacent Central Criminal Court, accused murderers, on going to and returning from trial,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0377.wav|The older officers, with several of whom I have conversed, have thus had unusual opportunities of watching the demeanor of murderers both before trial|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0379.wav|All as a rule, unless poignant remorse has brought a desire to court their richly-merited retribution, are buoyed up|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0380.wav|with hope to the last. There is always the chance of a flaw in the indictment, of a missing witness, or extenuating circumstances.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0381.wav|Even when in the condemned cell, with a shameful death within measurable distance,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0382.wav|many cling still to life, expecting much from the intercession of friends or the humanitarianism of the age.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0383.wav|All almost without exception sleep soundly at night, except the first after sentence,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0384.wav|when the first shock of the verdict and the solemn notification of the impending blow keeps nearly all awake, or at least disturbs their night's rest.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0385.wav|But the uneasiness soon wears off. The second night sleep comes readily, and is sound;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0386.wav|many of the most abandoned murderers snore peacefully their eight hours, even on the night immediately preceding execution.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0387.wav|All too have a fairly good appetite, and eat with relish, up to the last moment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0388.wav|A few go further, and are almost gluttonous.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0394.wav|The request was not granted, as the old custom of allowing capital convicts whatever they asked for in the way of food has not been the rule in Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0395.wav|The diet of the condemned is the ordinary diet of the prison,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0396.wav|but to which additions are sometimes made, chiefly of stimulants, if deemed necessary, by the medical officer of the jail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0397.wav|The craving for tobacco which so dominates the habitual smoker often leads the convicted to plead hard for a last smoke.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0406.wav|the condemned sermon was preached in the prison chapel, and this was probably only that he might hear the singing of a lady with a magnificent voice|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0436.wav|pointing to an aperture for ventilating the cell. On the morning of execution he asked how far it was to the gallows, and was told it was quite close.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0438.wav|that the convict's clothes were still the executioner's perquisite.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0439.wav|Often the convicts give way to despair. They are too closely watched to be allowed to do themselves much mischief, or suicides would probably be more frequent.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0440.wav|But it is neither easy to obtain the instruments of self-destruction nor to elude the vigilance of their guard.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0442.wav|made a determined effort to burn himself to death by throwing himself bodily on to the fire in the condemned ward.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0443.wav|He was promptly rescued from his perilous condition, but not before his face and hands were badly scorched.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0003.wav|Nevertheless, in order to give completeness to the picture|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0004.wav|I have attempted to draw of crime in connection with Newgate, from first to last, I must make some mention, in this my penultimate chapter,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0005.wav|of some of the most heinous offenses of modern times.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0006.wav|The crime of poisoning has always been viewed with peculiar loathing and terror in this country.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0007.wav|It will be remembered that as far back as the reign of Henry VIII. a new and most cruel penalty was devised for the punishment of the Bishop of Rochester's cook,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0008.wav|who had poisoned his master and many of his dependents.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0009.wav|Sir Thomas Overbury was undoubtedly poisoned by Lord Rochester in the reign of James I.,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0010.wav|and it is hinted that James himself nearly fell a victim to a nefarious attempt of the Duke of Buckingham.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0011.wav|But secret poisoning on a wholesale scale such as was practiced in Italy and France was happily never popularized in England.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0012.wav|The well-known and lethal aqua Toffania,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0013.wav|so called after its inventress, a Roman woman named Toffana, and which was so widely adopted by ladies anxious to get rid of their husbands,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0014.wav|was never introduced into this country. Its admission was probably checked by the increased vigilance at the custom houses,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0015.wav|the necessity for which was urged by Mr. Addison, when Secretary of State, in 1717.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0016.wav|The cases of poisoning in the British calendars are rare, nor indeed was the guilt of the accused always clearly established.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0017.wav|It is quite possible that Catherine Blandy, who poisoned her father at the instigation of her lover,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0018.wav|was ignorant of the destructive character of the powders, probably arsenic, which she administered.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0019.wav|Captain Donellan, who was convicted of poisoning his brother-in-law, Sir Theodosius Broughton, and executed for it,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0020.wav|would probably have had the benefit in these days of the doubts raised at his trial.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0021.wav|A third case, more especially interesting to us as having passed through Newgate,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0022.wav|was that of Eliza Fenning, who was convicted of an attempt to poison a whole family|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0023.wav|by putting arsenic in the dumplings she had prepared for them. The charge rested entirely on circumstantial evidence,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0024.wav|and as Fenning, although convicted and executed, protested her innocence in the most solemn manner to the last,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0025.wav|the justice of the sentence was doubted at the time.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0026.wav|Yet it was clearly proved that the dumplings contained arsenic, that she, and she alone, had made the dough,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0027.wav|that arsenic was within her reach in the house,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0028.wav|that she had had a quarrel with her mistress, and that the latter with all others who tasted the dumplings were similarly attacked, although no one died.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0029.wav|The crime of poisoning is essentially one which will be most prevalent in a high state of civilization,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0030.wav|when the spread of scientific knowledge places nefarious means at the disposal of many,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0031.wav|instead of limiting them, as in the days of the Borgias and Brinvilliers, to the specially informed and unscrupulously powerful few.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0032.wav|The first intimation conveyed to society of the new terror which threatened it was in the arrest and arraignment of William Palmer,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0033.wav|a medical practitioner, charged with doing to death persons who relied upon his professional skill.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0034.wav|The case contained elements of much uncertainty, and yet it was so essential,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0035.wav|in the interests and for the due protection of the public, that the fullest and fairest inquiry should be made,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0036.wav|that the trial was transferred to the Central Criminal Court,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0037.wav|under the authority of an Act passed on purpose, known as the Trial of offenses Act, and sometimes as Lord Campbell's Act.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0038.wav|That the administration of justice should never be interfered with by local prejudice or local feeling|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0039.wav|is obviously of paramount importance, and the powers granted by this Act have been frequently put in practice since.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0040.wav|The trial of Catherine Winsor, the baby farmer,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0041.wav|was thus brought to the Central Criminal Court from Exeter assizes, and that of the Stauntons from Maidstone.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0042.wav|Palmer's trial caused the most intense excitement.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0043.wav|The direful suspicions which surrounded the case filled the whole country with uneasiness and misgiving,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0044.wav|and the deepest anxiety was felt that the crime, if crime there had been, should be brought home to its perpetrator.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0045.wav|The Central Criminal Court was crowded to suffocation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0046.wav|Great personages occupied seats upon the bench;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0047.wav|the rest of the available space was allotted by ticket, to secure which the greatest influence was necessary.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0048.wav|People came to stare at the supposed cold-blooded prisoner;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0049.wav|with morbid curiosity to scan his features and watch his demeanor through the shifting, nicely-balanced phases of his protracted trial.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0050.wav|Palmer, who was only thirty-one at the time of his trial, was in appearance short and stout, with a round head|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0051.wav|covered rather scantily with light sandy hair.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0052.wav|His skin was extraordinarily fair, his cheeks fresh and ruddy; altogether his face, though commonplace, was not exactly ugly;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0053.wav|there was certainly nothing in it which indicated cruel cunning or deliberate truculence.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0054.wav|His features were not careworn, but rather set, and he looked older than his age.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0055.wav|Throughout his trial he preserved an impassive countenance, but he clearly took a deep interest in all that passed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0056.wav|Although the strain lasted fourteen days, he showed no signs of exhaustion, either physical or mental.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0057.wav|On returning to jail each day he talked freely and without reserve to the warders in charge of him, chiefly on incidents in the day's proceedings.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0058.wav|He was confident to the very last that it would be impossible to find him guilty;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0059.wav|even after sentence, and until within a few hours of execution, he was buoyed up with the hope of reprieve.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0060.wav|The conviction that he would escape had taken so firm a hold of him,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0061.wav|that he steadily refused to confess his guilt, lest it should militate against his chances.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0062.wav|In the condemned cell he frequently repeated, quote, I go to my death a murdered man, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0063.wav|He made no distinct admissions even on the scaffold; but when the chaplain at the last moment exhorted him to confess,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0064.wav|he made use of the remarkable words, quote, If it is necessary for my soul's sake to confess this murder,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0065.wav|I ought also to confess the others: I mean my wife and my brother's. End quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0066.wav|Yet he was silent when specifically pressed to confess that he had killed his wife and his brother.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0067.wav|Palmer was ably defended, but the weight of evidence was clearly with the prosecution, led by Sir Alexander Cockburn,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0068.wav|and public opinion at the termination of the trial coincided with the verdict of the jury.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0069.wav|Originally a doctor in practice at Rugeley, in Staffordshire, he had gradually withdrawn from medicine, and devoted himself to the turf;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0070.wav|but his sporting operations did not prosper, and he became a needy man, always driven to desperate straits for cash.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0071.wav|To meet his liabilities, he raised large sums on forged bills of acceptance drawn upon his mother, a woman of some means,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0072.wav|whose signature he counterfeited.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0073.wav|In 1854 he owed a very large sum of money, but he was temporarily relieved by the death of his wife,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0074.wav|whose life he had insured for £13,000.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0075.wav|There is every reason to suppose that he poisoned his wife to obtain possession of this sum upon her death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0076.wav|His brother was supposed to have been his next victim, upon whose life he had also effected an insurance for another £13,000.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0077.wav|The brother too died conveniently, but the life office took some exception to the manner of the death, and hesitated to disburse the funds claimed by Palmer.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0078.wav|Palmer tried to get a new insurance on the life of a hanger-on, one Bates, but no office would accept it, no doubt greatly to Bates's longevity.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0079.wav|Meanwhile the bill discounters who held the forged acceptances, with other promissory notes, began to clamor for payment, and talk of issuing writs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0080.wav|Palmer, alive to the danger he ran of a prosecution for forgery, should the fraud he had committed be brought to light,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0081.wav|sought about for a fresh victim to supply him with funds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0082.wav|He fixed upon a sporting friend, Mr. John Parsons Cook, who had been in luck at Shrewsbury races, both as a winner and a backer,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0083.wav|whom he persuaded to go and stay at Rugeley in an hotel just opposite his own house.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0084.wav|It was there that Cook was first taken ill with violent retchings and vomitings, all dating from visits of Palmer, who brought him medicines and food.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0085.wav|Palmer's plan was to administer poison in quantities insufficient to cause death, but enough to produce illness which would account for death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0086.wav|For this purpose he gave, or there was the strongest presumption that he gave,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0087.wav|antimony, which caused Cook's constant sickness.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0088.wav|Quantities of antimony were found in the body after death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0089.wav|While Cook lay ill, Palmer in his name pocketed the proceeds of the Shrewsbury settling,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0090.wav|and so got the money for which he was prepared to barter his soul.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0091.wav|The last act now approached, and in order to avoid the detection of this last fraud, Palmer laid his plans for disposing of Cook.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0092.wav|He decided to use strychnia, or the vegetable poison otherwise known as nux vomica;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0093.wav|and one of the many links in the long chain of evidence was an entry in a book of Palmer's to the effect that Quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0094.wav|strychnia kills by causing tetanic fixing of the respiratory muscles. End quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0095.wav|The purchase by Palmer of strychnia was proved.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0096.wav|The night he bought it, Cook, who had been taking certain pills under medical advice, not Palmer's, was seized with violent convulsions.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0097.wav|He had swallowed his pills as usual, at least Palmer had administered them|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0098.wav|whether the ordinary or his own pills will never be known, except as may be inferred from the results, which indicate that he had taken the latter.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0099.wav|Cook recovered this time; it was probably Palmer's intention that he should recover, wishing to encourage the supposition that Cook was in a bad way.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0100.wav|Next night Cook had a second and a more violent attack.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0101.wav|That day Palmer had bought more strychnia, and had called in a fresh doctor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0102.wav|The second attack was fatal, and ended in Cook's death from tetanus.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0103.wav|This tetanus, according to the prosecution, was produced by strychnia, and followed the administration of pills by Palmer|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0104.wav|prescribed nominally by the fresh doctor, for which Palmer had substituted his own.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0105.wav|Cook's death was horrible|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0106.wav|fearful paroxysms and cramps, ending in suffocation by the tetanic rigor which caught the muscles of the chest.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0107.wav|After Cook's death his stepfather, who was much attached to him, came to Rugeley.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0108.wav|He was struck with the appearance of the corpse, which was not emaciated, as after a long disease ending in death;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0109.wav|while the muscles of the fingers were tightly clenched, not open, as usual in a corpse.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0110.wav|He said nothing, but began to feel uneasy when he found that Cook's betting-book was missing, and that Palmer put it forward|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0111.wav|that his friend had died greatly embarrassed, with bills to the amount of £4000 out in his name.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0112.wav|Palmer too showed an indecent haste in preparing the body for interment, and in obtaining the usual certificate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0113.wav|After this the step-father insisted upon a post-mortem, which was conducted somewhat carelessly.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0114.wav|The intestines were, however, preserved and sent for analysis,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0115.wav|but it was proved that Palmer tried hard to get possession of the jar containing them,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0116.wav|and even sought to upset the vehicle by which they were being conveyed a part of the way to London.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0117.wav|The examination of the stomach betrayed the presence of antimony in large quantities, but no strychnia,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0118.wav|and it was on the entire absence of the latter that the defense was principally based when Palmer was brought to trial.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0119.wav|All the circumstances were so suspicious that he could not escape the criminal charge.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0120.wav|He had already been arrested on a writ issued at the instance of the money-lenders, and an action had been commenced against Mrs. Palmer on her acceptances.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0121.wav|It came out at once that these had been forged, and the whole affair at once took the ugliest complexion.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0122.wav|A government prosecution was instituted, and Palmer was brought to Newgate for trial at the Central Criminal Court.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0123.wav|There was not much reserve about him when there.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0124.wav|He frequently declared before and during the trial that it would be impossible to find him guilty.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0125.wav|He never actually said that he was not guilty, but he was confident he would not be convicted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0126.wav|He relied on the absence of the strychnia.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0127.wav|But the chain of circumstantial evidence was strong enough to satisfy the jury, who agreed to their verdict in an hour.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0128.wav|At the last moment Palmer tossed a bit of paper over to his counsel, on which he had written, quote, I think there will be a verdict of Not Guilty, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0129.wav|Even after the death sentence had been passed upon him he clung to the hope that the Government would grant him a reprieve.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0130.wav|To the last, therefore, he played the part of a man wrongfully convicted, and did not abandon hope|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0131.wav|even when the high sheriff had told him there was no possibility of a reprieve, and within a few hours of execution.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0132.wav|He suffered at Stafford in front of the jail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0133.wav|Palmer speedily found imitators.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0134.wav|Within a few weeks occurred the Leeds poisoning case, in which the murderer undoubtedly was inspired by the facts made public at Palmer's trial.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0135.wav|Dove, a fiendish brute, found from the evidence in that case that he could kill his wife, whom he hated,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0136.wav|with exquisite torture, and with a poison that would leave, as he thought, no trace.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0137.wav|In the latter hope he was happily disappointed. But as this case is beyond my subject, I merely mention it as one of the group already referred to.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0138.wav|Three years later came the case of Dr. Smethurst,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0139.wav|presenting still greater features of resemblance with Palmer's, for both were medical men, and both raised difficult questions of medical jurisprudence.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0140.wav|In both the jury had no doubt as to the guilt of the accused, only in Smethurst's case the then Home Secretary, Sir George Cornewall Lewis,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0141.wav|could not divest his mind of serious doubt, and of which the murderer got the benefit.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0142.wav|Smethurst's escape may have influenced the jury in the Poplar poisoning case,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0143.wav|"which followed close on its heels, although in that the verdict of ""Not Guilty"" was excusable, as the evidence was entirely circumstantial."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0144.wav|There was no convincing proof that the accused had administered the poison, although beyond question that poison had occasioned the death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0145.wav|Dr. Smethurst was long an inmate of Newgate, and was tried at the Central Criminal Court.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0146.wav|He had all the characteristics of the poisoner -- the calm deliberation,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0147.wav|the protracted dissimulation, as with unshrinking, relentless wickedness the deadly work is carried on to the end.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0148.wav|Smethurst's victim was a Miss Bankes, with whom he had contracted a bigamous marriage.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0149.wav|"He had met her at a boarding-house, where he lived with his own wife, a person of ""shady"" antecedents,"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0150.wav|and whom he left without scruple to join Miss Bankes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0151.wav|The latter seems to have succumbed only too willingly to his fascinations, and to have as readily agreed to marry him,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0152.wav|in spite of the existence of the other Mrs. Smethurst.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0153.wav|Probably the doctor had told her the story he brought forward when tried for bigamy, namely,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0154.wav|that Mrs. Smethurst had no right to the name, but had a husband of her own, one Johnson, alive -- a story subsequently disproved.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0155.wav|Miss Bankes seems to have counted upon some species of whitewashing, no less than the repudiation of the other marriage,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0156.wav|and told her sister as much when they last met.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0157.wav|For some months Smethurst and Miss Bankes lived together as man and wife, first in London, and then at Richmond.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0158.wav|She had a little fortune of her own, some £1700 or £1800,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0159.wav|and a life-interest in £5000, a fact on which Smethurst's counsel dwelt with much weight,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0160.wav|as indicating a motive for keeping her alive rather than killing her.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0161.wav|But probably the lump sum was the bait, or perhaps Smethurst wished to return to his temporarily deserted first wife.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0162.wav|Whatever the exact cause which impelled him to crime, it seems certain that he began to give her some poison,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0163.wav|either arsenic or antimony, or both, in small quantities,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0164.wav|with the idea of subjecting her to the irritant poison slowly but surely until the desired effect, death, was achieved.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0165.wav|As she became worse and worse, Smethurst called in the best medical advice in Richmond,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0166.wav|but was careful to prime them with his facts and lead them if possible to accept his diagnosis of the case.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0167.wav|Smethurst was found guilty by the jury, and sentenced to death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0168.wav|But a long public discussion followed, and in consequence he was reprieved.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0169.wav|The Home Secretary, in a letter to the Lord Chief Baron, stated that, quote, although the facts are full of suspicion against Smethurst,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0170.wav|there is not absolute and complete evidence of his guilt. End quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0171.wav|Smethurst was therefore given a free pardon for the offense of murder,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0172.wav|but he was subsequently again tried for bigamy, and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0173.wav|Catherine Wilson was a female poisoner who did business wholesale.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0174.wav|She was tried in April 1862 on suspicion of having attempted to poison a neighbor with oil of vitriol.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0175.wav|The circumstances were strange. Mrs. Wilson had gone to the chemist's for medicine,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0176.wav|and on her return had administered a dose of something which burnt the mouth badly, but did not prove fatal.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0177.wav|Wilson was acquitted on this charge, but other suspicious facts cropped up while she was in Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0178.wav|It appeared that several persons with whom she was intimate had succumbed suddenly.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0179.wav|In all cases the symptoms were much the same,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0180.wav|vomiting, violent retching, purging, such as are visible in cholera, and all dated from the time when she knew a young man named Dixon,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0181.wav|who had been in the habit of taking colchicum for rheumatism. Mrs. Wilson heard then casually from a medical man|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0182.wav|that it was a very dangerous medicine, and she profited by what she had heard.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0183.wav|Soon afterwards Dixon died, showing all the symptoms already described.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0184.wav|Soon afterwards a friend, Mrs. Atkinson, came to London from Westmoreland, and stayed in Mrs. Wilson's house.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0185.wav|She was in good health on leaving home, and had with her a large sum of money.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0186.wav|While with Mrs. Wilson she became suddenly and alarmingly ill, and died in great agony.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0187.wav|Her husband, who came up to town, would not allow a post-mortem, and again Mrs. Wilson escaped.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0188.wav|Mrs. Atkinson's symptoms had been the same as Dixon's. Then Mrs. Wilson went to live with a man named Taylor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0189.wav|who was presently attacked in the same way as the others, but, but, thanks to the prompt administration of remedies, he recovered.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0190.wav|After this came the charge of administering oil of vitriol, which failed, as has been described.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0191.wav|Last of all Mrs. Wilson poisoned her landlady, Mrs. Soames, under precisely the same conditions as the foregoing.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0192.wav|Here, however, the evidence was strong and sufficient.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0193.wav|It was proved that Mrs. Wilson had given Mrs. Soames something peculiar to drink,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0194.wav|that immediately afterwards Mrs. Soames was taken ill with vomiting and purging,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0195.wav|and that Mrs. Wilson administered the same medicine again and again.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0196.wav|The last time Mrs. Soames showed great reluctance to take it, but Wilson said it would certainly do her good.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0197.wav|This mysterious medicine Wilson kept carefully locked up, and allowed no one to see it,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0198.wav|but its nature was betrayed when this last victim also died.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0199.wav|The first post-mortem indicated death from natural causes,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0200.wav|but a more careful investigation attributed it beyond doubt to over-doses of colchicum.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0201.wav|Dr. Alfred Taylor, the great authority and writer on medical jurisprudence, corroborated this, and in his evidence on the trial|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0202.wav|fairly electrified the court by declaring it his opinion that many deaths, supposed to be from cholera, were really due to poison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0203.wav|This fact was referred to by the judge in his summing up,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0204.wav|who said that he feared it was only too true that secret poisoning was at that time very rife in the metropolis.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0205.wav|Wilson was duly sentenced to death, and suffered impenitent, hardened, and without any confession of her guilt.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0206.wav|Although murder by insidious methods had become more common, cases where violence of the most deadly and determined kind was offered|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0207.wav|had not quite disappeared. I will mention two cases of this class, one accompanied with piracy on the high seas,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0208.wav|the other perpetrated in a railway-carriage, and showing the promptitude with which criminals accept and utilize altered conditions of life,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0209.wav|more particularly as regards locomotion.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0210.wav|The first case was that of the 'Flowery Land,'|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0211.wav|which left London for Singapore on the 28th July, 1863, with a cargo of wine and other goods.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0212.wav|Her captain was John Smith;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0213.wav|the first and second mates, Karswell and Taffir; there were two other Englishmen on board, and the rest of the crew were a polyglot lot,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0214.wav|most of them, as was proved by their subsequent acts, blackguards of the deepest dye.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0215.wav|Six were Spaniards, or rather natives of Manilla, and men of color; one was a Greek, another a Turk;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0216.wav|"there were also a Frenchman, a Norwegian (the carpenter), three Chinamen, a ""Sclavonian,"" and a black on board."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0217.wav|Navigation and discipline could not be easy with such a nondescript crew.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0218.wav|The captain was kindly but somewhat intemperate, the first mate a man of some determination,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0219.wav|and punishment such as rope's-ending and tying to the bulwarks had to be applied to get the work properly done.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0220.wav|The six Spaniards, the Greek, and the Turk were in the same watch,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0221.wav|eight truculent and reckless scoundrels, who, brooding over their fancied wrongs, and burning for revenge,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0222.wav|hatched amongst them a plot to murder their officers and seize the ship.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0223.wav|The mutiny was organized with great secrecy, and broke out most unexpectedly in the middle of the night.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0224.wav|A simultaneous attack was made upon the captain and the first mate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0225.wav|The latter had the watch on deck.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0226.wav|One half of the mutineers fell upon him unawares with handspikes and capstan-bars.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0227.wav|He was struck down, imploring mercy, but they beat him about the head and face|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0228.wav|till every feature was obliterated, and then, still living, flung him into the sea.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0229.wav|Meanwhile the captain, roused from his berth,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0230.wav|came out of the cabin, was caught near the 'companion' by the rest of the mutineers, and promptly dispatched with daggers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0231.wav|His body was found lying in a pool of blood in a night-dress, stabbed over and over again in the left side.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0232.wav|The captain's brother, a passenger on board the 'Flowery Land,' was also stabbed to death and his body thrown overboard.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0233.wav|The second mate, who had heard the hammering of the capstan-bars and the handspikes, with the first mate's and captain's agonized cries, had come out,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0234.wav|verified the murderers, and then shut himself up in his cabin.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0235.wav|He was soon summoned on deck, but as he would not move, the mutineers came down and stood in a circle round his berth.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0236.wav|Leon, or Lyons, who spoke English,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0237.wav|when asked said they would spare his life if he would navigate the ship for them to the River Plate or Buenos Aires.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0238.wav|Taffir, the second mate, agreed, but constantly went in fear of his life for the remainder of the voyage;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0239.wav|and although the mutineers spared him, they ill-treated the Chinamen, and cut one badly with knives.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0240.wav|Immediately after the murder cases of champagne, which formed part of the cargo, were brought on deck and broached;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0241.wav|the captain's cabin ransacked, his money and clothes divided amongst the mutineers, as well as much of the merchandise on board.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0242.wav|Leon wished to make every one on board share and share alike, so as to implicate the innocent with the guilty;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0243.wav|but Vartos, or Watto, the Turk, would not allow any but the eight mutineers to have anything.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0244.wav|The murders were perpetrated on the 10th September, and the ship continued her voyage for nearly three weeks, meeting and speaking one ship only.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0245.wav|On the 2nd October they sighted land, ten miles distant;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0246.wav|the mutineers took command of the ship, put her about till night-fall, by which time they had scuttled her, got out the boats, and all left the ship.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0247.wav|The rest of the crew were also permitted to embark, except the Chinamen, one of whom was thrown into the water and drowned,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0249.wav|The boats reached the shore on the 4th October. Leon had prepared a plausible tale to the effect that they belonged to an American ship|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0002.wav|In July 1864 occurred the murder of Mr. Briggs, a gentleman advanced in years and chief clerk in Robarts' bank.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0003.wav|As the circumstances under which it was perpetrated were somewhat novel,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0004.wav|and as some time elapsed before the discovery and apprehension of the supposed murderer,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0005.wav|the public mind was greatly agitated by the affair for several months. The story of the murder must be pretty familiar to most of my readers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0006.wav|Mr. Briggs left the bank one afternoon as usual, dined with his daughter at Peckham,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0007.wav|then returned to the city to take the train from Fenchurch Street home, traveling by the North London Railway.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0008.wav|He lived at Hackney, but he never reached it alive.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0009.wav|When the train arrived at Hackney station, a passenger who was about to enter one of the carriages found the cushions soaked with blood.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0010.wav|Inside the carriage was a hat, a walking-stick, and a small black leather bag.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0011.wav|About the same time a body was discovered on the line near the railway-bridge by Victoria Park.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0012.wav|It was that of an aged man, whose head had been battered in by a life-preserver.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0013.wav|There was a deep wound just over the ear, the skull was fractured, and there were several other blows and wounds on the head.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0014.wav|Strange to say, the unfortunate man was not yet dead, and he actually survived more than four-and-twenty hours.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0015.wav|His identity was established by a bundle of letters in his pocket, which bore his full address:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0016.wav|T. Briggs, Esq., Robarts & Co., Lombard Street.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0017.wav|The friends of Mr. Briggs were communicated with, and it was ascertained that when he left home the morning of the murderous attack,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0018.wav|he wore gold-rimmed eye-glasses and a gold watch and chain.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0019.wav|The stick and bag were his, but not the hat.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0020.wav|A desperate and deadly struggle must have taken place in the carriage, and the stain of a bloody hand marked the door.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0021.wav|The facts of the murder and its object, robbery, were thus conclusively proved.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0022.wav|It was also easily established that the hat found in the carriage had been bought at Walker's, a hatter's in Crawford Street,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0023.wav|Marylebone; while within a few days Mr. Briggs' gold chain was traced to a jeweler's in Cheapside,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0024.wav|Mr. Death, who had given another in exchange for it to a man supposed to be a foreigner.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0025.wav|More precise clues to the murderer were not long wanting; indeed the readiness with which they were produced and followed up|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0026.wav|showed how greatly the publicity and wide dissemination of the news regarding murder facilitate the detection of crime.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0027.wav|In little more than a week a cabman came forward and voluntarily made a statement which at once drew suspicion to a German, Franz Müller,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0028.wav|who had been a lodger of his. Müller had given the cabman's little daughter a jeweler's cardboard box bearing the name of Mr. Death.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0029.wav|A photograph of Müller shown the jeweler was identified as the likeness of the man who had exchanged Mr. Briggs' chain.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0030.wav|Last of all, the cabman swore that he had bought the very hat found in the carriage for Müller at the hatter's, Walker's of Crawford Street.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0031.wav|This fixed the crime pretty certainly upon Müller, who had already left the country, thus increasing suspicion under which he lay.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0032.wav|There was no mystery about his departure; he had gone to Canada, by the 'Victoria' sailing ship, starting from the London docks, and bound to New York.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0033.wav|Directly the foregoing facts were established, a couple of detective officers, armed with a warrant to arrest Müller,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0034.wav|and accompanied by Mr. Death the jeweler and the cabman, went down to Liverpool and took the first steamer across the Atlantic.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0035.wav|This was the 'City of Manchester,' which was expected to arrive some days before the 'Victoria,' and did so.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0036.wav|The officers went on board the 'Victoria' at once, Müller was identified by Mr. Death, and the arrest was made.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0037.wav|In searching the prisoner's box, Mr. Briggs' watch was found wrapped up in a piece of leather,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0038.wav|and Müller at the time of his capture was actually wearing Mr. Briggs' hat, cut down and somewhat altered.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0039.wav|The prisoner was forthwith extradited and sent back to England, which he reached with his escort on the 17th September the same year.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0040.wav|His trial followed at the next sessions of the Central Criminal Court, and ended in his conviction.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0041.wav|The case was one of circumstantial evidence, but, as Sir Robert Collyer the Solicitor-General pointed out,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0042.wav|it was the strongest circumstantial evidence which had ever been brought forward in a murder case.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0043.wav|It was really evidence of facts which could not be controverted or explained away.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0044.wav|There was the prisoner's poverty, his inability to account for himself on the night of the murder, and his possession of the property of the murdered man.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0045.wav|An alibi was set up for the defense, but not well substantiated, and the jury without hesitation returned a verdict of guilty.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0046.wav|Müller protested after sentence of death had been passed upon him that he had been convicted on a false statement of facts.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0047.wav|He adhered to this almost to the very last. His case had been warmly espoused by the Society for the Protection of Germans in this country,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0048.wav|and powerful influence was exerted both here and abroad to obtain a reprieve.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0049.wav|Müller knew that any confession would ruin his chances of escape.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0050.wav|"His arguments were specious and evasive when pressed to confess. ""Why should man confess to man?"" he replied;"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0051.wav|man cannot forgive man, only God can do so. Man is therefore only accountable to God.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0052.wav|But on the gallows, when the cap was over his eyes and the rope had been adjusted round his neck, and within a second of the moment when he would be launched into eternity,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0053.wav|he whispered in the ear of the German pastor who attended him on the scaffold,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0054.wav|While in the condemned cell he conversed freely with the warders in broken English or through an interpreter.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0055.wav|He is described as not a bad-looking man, with a square German type of face,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0056.wav|blue eyes which were generally half closed, and very fair hair.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0057.wav|He was short in stature, his legs were light for the upper part of his body, which was powerful, almost herculean.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0058.wav|It is generally supposed that he committed the murder under a sudden access of covetousness and greed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0059.wav|He saw Mr. Briggs' watch-chain, and followed him instantly into the carriage, determined to have it at all costs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0060.wav|His crime under this aspect of it was less premeditated, and less atrocious therefore, than that of Lefroy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0061.wav|One other curious murder may be added to the two foregoing.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0062.wav|Christian Sattler was by birth a German.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0063.wav|He had led a wild life; had left his native land and enlisted first in the French army in Algeria,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0064.wav|afterwards in the British German Legion raised for the Crimean War.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0065.wav|At the disbandment of the force, as he was without resources, he turned his attention to hotel robberies, by which he lived for some years.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0066.wav|He at length stole a carpet-bag containing valuables, and fled to Hamburgh.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0067.wav|Thither, he was pursued by a detective officer,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0068.wav|Inspector Thain, who, being unable to obtain his extradition legally, had him inveigled on board an English steamer,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0069.wav|where the arrest was made.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0070.wav|Sattler was ironed for safe custody,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0071.wav|a proceeding which he vehemently resented, and begged that they might be removed, as the handcuffs hurt his wrists.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0072.wav|The inspector said that they could not be removed till he reached England.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0073.wav|This reply of his contained no promise of immediate release.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0074.wav|Sattler probably misunderstood, and he declared that the police officer had broken faith with him, having, moreover, stated that|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0075.wav|while at sea the captain of the ship was responsible for the security of the prisoner.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0076.wav|As Sattler brooded over his wrongs, his rage got the upper hand, and he resolved to wreak it upon Thain.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0077.wav|Although manacled, he managed to get a pistol from his chest and load it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0078.wav|The next time Thain entered his cabin he fired at him point-blank, and lodged three bullets in his breast.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0079.wav|The unfortunate man survived till he landed, but died in Guy's Hospital.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0080.wav|Sattler was tried for murder and convicted;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0081.wav|his defense being that he had intended to commit suicide, but that, on the appearance of this officer who had wronged him,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0082.wav|he had yielded to an irresistible impulse to kill him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0083.wav|Sattler was a very excitable although not an ill-tempered man.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0084.wav|While in Newgate awaiting trial he frequently tried to justify his murder by declaring that the police officer had broken faith with him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0085.wav|He would shoot any man or any policeman like a dog, or any number of them, who had treated him in that way.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0089.wav|Another case of long-continued successful forgery was brought to light two years after the convictions of Saward and his accomplices.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0090.wav|This conspiracy was cleverly planned, but had scarcely so many ramifications as that of Saward. Its originators were a couple of men,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0091.wav|Wagner and Bateman, who had already been convicted of systematic forgery, and sentenced to transportation, but they had been released on ticket-of-leave|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0092.wav|in 1856.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0093.wav|As a blind for their new frauds, they set up as law-stationers in York Buildings, Adelphi, and at once commenced their nefarious traffic.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0094.wav|Forged cheques and bills were soon uttered in great numbers, as well as base coin.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0095.wav|The police suspecting the house in York Buildings, put a watch on the premises, which they kept up for more than a year,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0096.wav|and thus obtained personal knowledge of all who passed in and out, but without obtaining any direct evidence.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0097.wav|At length a man was caught in the act of passing a forged cheque at the Union Bank,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0099.wav|Among them was a man named Chandler, formerly a bill discounter by profession, who by degrees, to meet his extravagant expenditure,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0105.wav|He, like Saward, was an artist in penmanship.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0106.wav|He was a German named Kerp,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0107.wav|eighty years of age, who had spent his whole life in imitating other people's signatures, and had acquired the most consummate skill in the practice.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0108.wav|His copies were generally pronounced indistinguishable from and as good as the originals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0109.wav|The aged but wary Kerp, the moment the plot was discovered, vanished, and was never more heard of.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0110.wav|Much the same plan was adopted by these forgers as by Saward to get their cheques cashed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0111.wav|They advertised for clerks, and employed the most likely of the applicants by sending them to the bank.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0112.wav|It was one of these, Glendinning, who had allowed himself to be utilized for some time in this way, whose capture led to the breaking up of the gang.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0113.wav|The principals in this conspiracy, Wagner and Bateman, were sentenced to penal servitude for life,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0114.wav|the others to twenty and ten years.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0115.wav|It was stated in evidence that the monies obtained by these forgeries amounted to £8000 or £10,000,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0116.wav|and that the forged cheques which had been presented, but refused, amounted to double the sum.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0117.wav|Wagner, after conviction, offered to reveal, for a reward of £3000|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0118.wav|a system which had long been in practice of defrauding the Exchequer of vast sums by means of forged stamps.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0119.wav|His offer was not, however, accepted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0120.wav|A more elaborate plot in many ways, more secretly, more patiently prepared than the preceding, or indeed than any in the calendar,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0121.wav|was the case of the forgeries upon the Bank of England discovered in 1863,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0122.wav|but not before the forged paper had been put in circulation for more than a couple of years. In 1861,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0123.wav|a man named Burnett came with his wife and took up his residence at Whitchurch, Hampshire, at no great distance from Laverstock,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0124.wav|where are Messrs. Portal's mills for the manufacture of bank-note paper.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0125.wav|Burnett had only just come out of jail after completing a sentence of penal servitude.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0126.wav|His object in visiting Whitchurch was to undermine the honesty of some workman in the mills;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0127.wav|and he eventually succeeded, his wife making the first overtures, in persuading a lad named Brown to steal some of the bank paper.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0128.wav|Brown took several sheets, and then was detected by Brewer, a fellow-workman of superior grade,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0129.wav|who threatened to betray the theft. But Brewer, either before or after this, succumbed to temptation,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0130.wav|and stole paper on a much larger scale than Brown.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0131.wav|"All that was taken was handed over to Burnett, or a ""woman in black"" whom Brown met by appointment at Waterloo station."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0132.wav|To facilitate his operations, Brewer obtained a false master key from Burnett,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0133.wav|which gave him access to all parts of the mills, the packing-room included.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0134.wav|In this part of the mills a large quantity of bank-note paper was kept at the period of the robbery,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0135.wav|"and in the states known as ""water-leaf"" and ""sized,"" which are the penultimate processes of manufacture."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0136.wav|"One more remains, that of ""glazing,"" without which no paper is issued for engraving."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0137.wav|None of the stolen paper was glazed, and this was an important clue to the subsequent discovery of the crime.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0138.wav|Some time in 1862, a large deficiency in stock of bank paper unglazed was discovered at the mills.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0139.wav|Soon afterwards the inspectors of bank-notes at the Bank of England detected the presentation at the bank of spurious notes on genuine paper.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0140.wav|The two facts taken in conjunction|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0141.wav|led to the employment of the police, and the offer of a reward of £1500 for the detection of the offenders.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0142.wav|By this time Brown alone had stolen three or four hundred sheets,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0143.wav|each containing two notes, many of the sheets suitable for engraving any kind of note from £1000 downwards.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0144.wav|The amount of Brewer's abstractions (who was eventually acquitted) was never exactly estimated.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0145.wav|Suspicion appears to have rested on Brown, who had left Laverstock,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0146.wav|and he was soon approached by the police. Almost directly he was questioned he made a clean breast of the whole affair.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0147.wav|The next step was to take the principals, and under such circumstances as would insure their conviction.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0148.wav|A watch was set on Burnett, who was followed to the shop of one Buncher, a butcher in Strutton Ground.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0149.wav|Buncher was then tracked to North Kent Terrace, New Cross, where a Mr. and Mrs. Campbell resided,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0150.wav|with whom he did business in exchanging the false notes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0151.wav|The police officers now taxed Mrs. Campbell with complicity, and frightened her into collusion.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0152.wav|With her assistance on a certain day a couple of bricks were taken out of the wall dividing her front and back parlors;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0153.wav|the officers ensconced themselves in the latter, and waited for Buncher's expected visit.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0154.wav|He came to complete a sale of forged notes, and he wanted a couple of hundred pounds for what he had.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0155.wav|Mrs. Campbell offered him less, and there was an altercation, in the course of which Buncher became very violent, and at length,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0156.wav|after using much intemperate language, he left the place in a huff.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0157.wav|In the course of his remarks, however, he said,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0158.wav|I am the man that has got all the bank paper; I have £30,000 now, and the Bank of England cannot stop it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0159.wav|This was all the police wanted to know.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0160.wav|They next watched Buncher, and found that he paid frequent visits to Birmingham.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0161.wav|They also discovered that through the intermediacy of one Robert Cummings, well known as a reputed coiner,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0162.wav|he had been introduced to a man named Griffiths, an engraver and copper-plate printer.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0163.wav|Griffiths was an unusually clever and skilful workman,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0164.wav|who had devoted all his talent and all his energies for some seventeen years to the fabrication of false bank-notes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0165.wav|On a certain day, the 27th October, 1862, the two were arrested simultaneously;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0166.wav|Buncher in London, and Griffiths in Birmingham.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0167.wav|Nothing was found in Buncher's premises in Strutton Ground, which were thoroughly searched,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0168.wav|but proofs of Griffiths' guilt were at once apparent on entering his work-room.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0169.wav|In one corner was a printing-press actually in use, and on it were twenty-one forged Bank of England notes, without date or signature.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0170.wav|On the bed were twenty forged ten-pound notes complete and ready for use, and twenty-five five-pound notes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0171.wav|Mother plates for engraving the body of the notes lay about, and other plates for various processes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0172.wav|More than this, Griffiths took the police to a field where, in a bank, a number of other plates were secreted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0173.wav|Griffiths afterwards admitted that he had been employed in defrauding the bank since 1846,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0174.wav|and the prominent part he played secured for him on conviction the heaviest sentence of the law.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0175.wav|This was penal servitude for life, Buncher's sentence being twenty-five, and Burnett's twenty years.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0176.wav|Cummings, who had introduced Buncher to Griffiths, was also tried for being in possession of stolen bank paper for improper purposes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0177.wav|But as there was no independent corroboration of the informer's evidence, according to the custom of the British law,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0178.wav|the case was considered not proved, and he was acquitted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0179.wav|On his return to Newgate to be finally discharged, Cummings jumped up the stairs and fairly danced for joy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0180.wav|But he was not long at large; he was too active an evil-doer|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0181.wav|and was perpetually in trouble. Commencing life as a resurrection man, when that trade failed through the change in the law,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0182.wav|and no more bodies were to be bought|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0183.wav|he devoted his energies to coining and forgery, and in the latter line was a friend and associate of Saward's.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0184.wav|One narrow escape he had, however, before he abandoned his old business.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0185.wav|A Bow Street officer saw him leaving London in the evening by Camberwell Green, accompanied by two other men.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0186.wav|It was well known that they were resurrectionists, and a strict watch was kept at all the turnpike gates on the southern roads leading into London.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0187.wav|An officer was placed for this purpose at New Cross, Camberwell, and Kennington gates.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0188.wav|"Presently ""Old Bob"" drove up to Camberwell Gate in the same cart in which he had been seen to start."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0189.wav|"The officers rushed out to detain him. ""What have you got here? We must search the cart,"" they cry."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0190.wav|By all means, replies Bob, and a close investigation follows, without any detection of the corpse concealed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0191.wav|Bob was therefore allowed to pass on.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0192.wav|But they had the body, all the same; it had been dressed up in decent clothes and made to stand upright in the cart.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0193.wav|With the police officers it had passed muster as a living member of the party.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0194.wav|"Cummings was repeatedly ""run in"" for the offense of coining and uttering bad money, whether coin or notes."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0195.wav|His regular trade, followed before he took to the life of resurrectionist, was that of an engraver.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0196.wav|He was a notorious criminal,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0197.wav|an habitual offender in his own particular line, one who would stick at no trifles to evade detection or escape capture.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0198.wav|"It is told of ""Bob"" Brennan, an official specially employed for years by the Mint"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0199.wav|to watch and prosecute coiners, that he received information that coining was carried on by Cummings and others at a place in Westminster.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0200.wav|He went there with a posse of officers and forced his way upstairs to the first floor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0201.wav|where the coiners, unexpectedly disturbed, fell an easy prey.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0202.wav|But the police nearly paid the penalty of capture with their lives.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0203.wav|Proceeding cautiously down the stairs, they found that the flooring at the bottom had been taken up.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0204.wav|Where it had lain was a yawning gulf or trap sufficient to do for the whole body of police engaged in the capture.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0205.wav|Cummings was caught shortly afterwards.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0206.wav|He was a tall, slender man, with a long face and iron-gray hair.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0207.wav|The community of coiners of which he was so notorious a member|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0208.wav|were a low lot, the lowest among criminals except, perhaps, the 'smashers,' or those who passed the counterfeit money.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0209.wav|It was not easy to detect coiners, or bring home their guilt to them.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0210.wav|Those who manufactured and those who passed had no direct dealings with each other.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0211.wav|"The false coin was bought by an agent from an agent, and dealings were carried on secretly at the ""Clock House"" in Seven Dials."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0212.wav|The annals of fraudulent crime probably contain nothing|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0213.wav|which in dramatic interest can compare with the conviction of William Roupell for forgery.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0214.wav|As the case must still be well remembered by the present generation, it will be necessary to give here only the briefest summary.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0215.wav|William Roupell was the eldest but illegitimate son of a wealthy man who subsequently married Roupell's mother, and had further legitimate issue.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0216.wav|William was brought up as an attorney, and became in due course his father's man of business.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0217.wav|As such he had pretty general control over his father's estates and affairs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0218.wav|In 1855|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0219.wav|he instructed certain solicitors to prepare a deed of gift as from his father, conveying to him estates near Kingston.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0220.wav|The old gentleman's signature to this deed of gift was a forgery,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0221.wav|but upon this forged and false conveyance William Roupell, who had already embarked upon a career of wild extravagance,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0222.wav|obtained a mortgage of £7000.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0223.wav|In 1856 the father died.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0224.wav|It had been supposed up to this date that he had willed his property, amounting in all to upwards of £200,000,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0225.wav|but after the funeral William Roupell produced another and a later will,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0226.wav|leaving everything to the widow, and constituting William sole executor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0227.wav|This will was a deliberate forgery.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0228.wav|Five or six years later, William Roupell minutely described how he had effected the fraud.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0229.wav|The day his father died he got the keys of his private bureau, opened it, and took out the authentic will.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0230.wav|After reading it, and finding this unfavorable to himself, he resolved to carry out his deliberate plan,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0231.wav|namely, to suppress it and substitute another.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0232.wav|He himself prepared it on a blank form which he had brought with him on purpose.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0233.wav|To this fraudulent instrument he appended forged signatures, and in due course obtained probate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0234.wav|As he possessed nearly unbounded influence over his mother, her accession to the property meant that William could dispose of it as he pleased.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0235.wav|He embarked forthwith in a career of the wildest extravagance, and ere long he had parted in his mother's name with most of the landed estates.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0236.wav|One large item of his expenditure was a contested election at Lambeth, which he gained at a cost of £10,000.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0256.wav|Roupell made a long statement more in exculpation than in his defense.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0257.wav|He complained that he had at first been the dupe of others, and admitted that he had too readily fallen astray.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0288.wav|After this the other conspirators traveled to obtain genuine bills and master the system of the leading houses at home and abroad.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0290.wav|by paying in a genuine bill of Messrs. Rothschilds' for £4500, which was duly discounted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0291.wav|Then he explained to the bank manager|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0295.wav|The fraud was rendered possible by the absence of a check usual in the United States.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0297.wav|It was the discovery of this flaw in the banking system which had encouraged the Americans to attempt this crime.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0298.wav|Time was clearly an important factor in the fraud, hence the bills were sent forward in quick succession.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0299.wav|Long before they came to maturity the forgers hoped to be well beyond arrest. They had, moreover, sought to destroy all clue.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0302.wav|For these cash was obtained in notes; the notes were exchanged by one of the conspirators for gold at the Bank of England, and again the same day|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0303.wav|a second conspirator exchanged the gold for notes. But just as all promised well, the frauds were detected through the carelessness of the forgers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0304.wav|They had omitted to insert the dates in certain bills.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0305.wav|The bills were sent as a matter of form to the drawer to have the date added, and the forgery was at once detected.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0306.wav|Noyes was seized without difficulty, as it was a part of the scheme that he should act as the dupe, and remain on the spot in London till all the money was obtained.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0307.wav|Through Noyes the rest of the conspirators were eventually apprehended. Very little if any of the ill-gotten proceeds, however, was ever recovered.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0312.wav|A plot was soon discovered,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0313.wav|deep laid, and with many ramifications, by which some of the Newgate warders were to be bribed to allow the prisoners to escape from their cells at night.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0314.wav|Certain friends of the prisoners were watched, and found to be in communication with these warders,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0315.wav|to whom it was said £100 apiece had been given down as the price of their infidelity.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0317.wav|and one warder admitted that he was to have £1000 more paid to him, and to be provided with a passage to Australia.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0318.wav|The vigilance of the Newgate officials, assisted by the city police, completely frustrated this plot.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0319.wav|A second was nevertheless set on foot,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0320.wav|in which the plan of action was changed, and the freedom of the prisoners was to be obtained by means of a rescue from the dock during the trial.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0321.wav|An increase of policemen on duty sufficed to prevent any attempt of this kind.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0010.wav|As regards the first, however, Sir James Graham, when Home Secretary in 1843,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0012.wav|which were then recommended to and generally adopted by the visiting justices all over the kingdom.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0014.wav|had embarked on a considerable expenditure in order to provide a model prison for general imitation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0015.wav|The first stone of Pentonville prison was laid on the 10th April, 1840, by the Marquis of Normanby,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0017.wav|This building was a costly affair. The site was uneven, and had to be leveled;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0018.wav|"moreover, the gross expenditure was increased ""partly from its being considered necessary, as it was a national prison,"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0019.wav|to make a great archway, and to make the character of it more imposing than if it had been situated in the country, and had been an ordinary prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0020.wav|Up to the 21st December, 1842,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0021.wav|with the additions made to that date, the total expenditure amounted to nearly £90,000, or about £180 per cell.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0022.wav|On the other hand, it must be admitted|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0023.wav|that this was an experimental construction, and that too strict a limitation of outlay would have militated seriously against the usefulness of the building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0024.wav|Nor must it be overlooked that this, the first model prison, although obtained at a considerable cost, became actually what its name implied.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0025.wav|Pentonville has really been the model on which all subsequent prison construction has been based. All prisons at home and abroad are but variations,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0026.wav|of course with the added improvements following longer experience, of the pattern originated by the architectural genius of Sir Joshua Jebb.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0027.wav|The internal arrangements of the new model were carefully supervised by a body of distinguished men, among which were many peers, Lord John Russell,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0028.wav|Mr. Shaw-Lefevre, the Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Benjamin Brodie,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0029.wav|Major Jebb, R.E., and the two prison inspectors, Messrs. Crawford and Russell, with whose names the reader is already familiar.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0030.wav|Major, afterwards Sir Joshua Jebb,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0031.wav|was the moving spirit among these commissioners, and he is now generally recognized as the originator of modern prison architecture.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0032.wav|The movement thus laudably initiated by the Government soon spread to the provinces.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0033.wav|Some jurisdictions, greatly to their credit, strove at once to follow the lead of the central authority.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0034.wav|Within half-a-dozen years no less than fifty-four new prisons were built on the Pentonville plan, others were in progress,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0035.wav|and the total number of separate cells provided amounted to eleven thousand odd.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0036.wav|This list included Wakefield, Leeds, Kirkdale, Manchester, Birmingham, and Dublin.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0037.wav|Liverpool was building a new prison with a thousand cells, the county of Surrey one with seven hundred.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0038.wav|The cost in each varied considerably, the general average being from £120 to £130 per cell.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0039.wav|At Pentonville the rate was higher, but there the expense had been increased by the site,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0040.wav|the difficulty of access, and the admitted necessity of giving architectural importance to this the national model prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0041.wav|Other jurisdictions were less prompt to recognize their responsibilities, the city of London among the number, as I shall presently show at length.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0042.wav|These were either satisfied with a makeshift, and modified existing buildings, without close regard to their suitability, or for a long time did nothing at all.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0043.wav|Among the latter were notably the counties of Cheshire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Nottinghamshire, the East and North Ridings of Yorkshire.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0044.wav|The south and west of England were also very laggard, and many years were still to elapse before the prisons in these parts were properly reconstituted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0045.wav|Not less remarkable than this diverse interpretation of a manifest duty|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0046.wav|was the variety of views as regards the discipline to be introduced in these new prisons. The time was one|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0047.wav|when thoughtful people who concerned themselves closely with social questions were greatly exercised as to the best system of treating the inmates of a jail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0048.wav|A new and still imperfectly understood science had arisen,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0049.wav|the principles of which were debated by disputants of widely opposite opinions with an earnestness that sometimes bordered upon acrimony.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0050.wav|One school were strongly in favor of the continuous separation of prisoners,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0051.wav|the other supported the theory of labor in association, but under a stringent rule of silence, with isolation only at night.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0052.wav|Both systems came to us from the United States. The difference was really more in degree than in principle,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0053.wav|and our modern practice has prudently tried to steer between the two extremes, accepting as the best system a judicious combination of both.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0054.wav|But about 1850 the two sides were distinctly hostile, and the controversy ran high.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0055.wav|High authorities were in favor of continuous separation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0056.wav|Colonel Jebb preferred it; Messrs. Crawford and Whitworth Russell were convinced that the complete isolation of criminals from one another|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0057.wav|was the true basis of a sound system of prison discipline.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0058.wav|Prison chaplains of experience and high repute, such as Messrs. Field, Clay, Kingsmill, Burt, and Osborne, also advocated it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0059.wav|It was claimed for it that it was more deterrent;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0060.wav|that in districts where it was the rule, evil-doers especially dreaded coming under its irksome conditions.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0061.wav|Another argument was, that it afforded more hope of the reformation of criminals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0062.wav|The system of associated labor in silence had also its warm supporters,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0063.wav|who maintained that under this system prisoners were more industrious and more healthy|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0064.wav|that their condition was more natural, and approximated more nearly to that of daily life.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0065.wav|Better industrial results were obtained from it, and instruction in trades was easier, and prisoners were more likely to leave jail|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0066.wav|with the means of earning an honest livelihood if so disposed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0067.wav|The opposing champions were not slow to find faults and flaws in the system they condemned.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0068.wav|Separation was injurious to health, mental or physical, said one side; men broke down when subjected to it for more than a certain period,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0069.wav|and it was unsafe to fix this limit above twelve months, although some rash advocates were in favor of eighteen months, some indeed of two years.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0070.wav|The other side retorted that the system of associated labor was most costly, so many officers being required to maintain the discipline of silence;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0071.wav|moreover, it was nearly impossible to prevent communication and mutual contamination.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0072.wav|It is scarcely necessary to follow the controversy further. I have only introduced the subject as showing how little as yet the State|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0073.wav|was impressed with the necessity for authoritative interference.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0074.wav|The legislature was content to let local jurisdictions experimentalize for themselves; with the strange, anomalous result,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0075.wav|that a thief or other criminal might be quite differently treated according as he was incarcerated on one side or another of a border line.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0076.wav|This variety was often extended to all branches of prison economy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0077.wav|There was an absolute want of uniformity in dietaries; in some prisons it was too liberal, in others too low.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0078.wav|The amount of exercise varied from one or two hours daily to half the working day.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0079.wav|The cells inhabited by prisoners were of very varying dimensions;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0080.wav|some were not sufficiently ventilated, others were warmed artificially, and were unwholesomely close.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0081.wav|The use of gas or some other means of lighting might be adopted, but more often was dispensed with.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0082.wav|In a great number of prisons no provision was made for the education of prisoners, in some others there was a sufficient staff of schoolmasters and instructors.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0083.wav|The discipline also varied greatly, from the severely penal to the culpably lax.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0084.wav|The greatest pains might be taken to secure isolation,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0085.wav|the prisoners might be supervised and watched at every step, and made liable to punishment for a trifling breach of an irksome code of regulations,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0086.wav|or they might herd together or communicate freely as in the old worst days. They might see each other when they liked, and converse sotto voce,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0087.wav|or make signs; or the chances of recognizing or being recognized were reduced to a minimum by the use of a mask.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0088.wav|There was no general rule of employment. Hard labor was often not insisted upon in separate confinement;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0089.wav|sometimes it embraced the tread-wheel or the newly-invented instruments known as cranks, which ground air.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0090.wav|The alternative between labor or idleness, or the selection of the form of labor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0091.wav|were mere matters of chance, and decided according to the views of the local magistracy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0092.wav|They were approved of and employed at some prisons, at others objected to because they were unproductive,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0093.wav|and because the machine was often so imperfect that the amount of effort could not be exactly regulated.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0094.wav|Opinions differed greatly with regard to the tread-wheel; some authorities advocated it as a very severe and irksome punishment,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0095.wav|which was yet under full control, and might be made to work corn-mills or prove otherwise productive;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0096.wav|"other authorities as strongly condemned it as brutalizing, unequal in its operation, and altogether a ""deplorable invention."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0097.wav|This want of uniformity in prison discipline became ere long an acknowledged evil pressing for some remedy,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0098.wav|and the question was once more taken up in the House of Commons. In 1849 Mr. Charles Pearson, M.P.,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0100.wav|but the session was far advanced, and the matter was relegated to the following year.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0101.wav|In 1850 Sir George Grey brought forward a new motion to the same effect,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0103.wav|The latter had reference more especially to a proposal emanating from Mr. Charles Pearson himself.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0105.wav|and that a new system of prison discipline should be introduced.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0106.wav|His plan was to devote the whole labor of prisoners sentenced to any term between three months and four years to agriculture.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0107.wav|District prisons were to be established for this purpose, each of which would be in the heart of a farm of a thousand acres.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0108.wav|The prisoners were to cultivate the land and raise sufficient produce for their own support.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0109.wav|Mr. Pearson backed up his recommendations by many sound arguments.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0110.wav|Field labor, he urged, and with reason, was a very suitable employment;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0111.wav|healthful, easily learnt, and well adapted to the circumstances of unskilled laborers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0112.wav|Such excellent returns might be counted upon, that a margin of profit would be left after the cost of the prisons had been defrayed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0113.wav|The scheme was no doubt fascinating, and in many respects feasible;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0114.wav|but Mr. Pearson overlooked some points in which a more practical mind would have foreseen difficulty, and perhaps forecasted failure.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0115.wav|In his proposal he dwelt much upon the humanizing effects of healthful open-air toil,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0116.wav|anticipating the best results from a system which made earnings, and indeed release, dependent upon the amount of work done.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0117.wav|That industry might thus be stimulated and encouraged was probable enough,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0118.wav|and later experience has fully proved the advantage of a judicious system of gratuities for labor;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0119.wav|but Mr. Pearson hardly considered the converse sufficiently, and|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0120.wav|omitted the fact that he might have to deal with that persistent idleness which is not an unknown characteristic of the criminal class.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0121.wav|The hope of reward might do much, but no system of penal discipline is complete unless it can also count upon the fear of punishment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0122.wav|Mr. Pearson seems to have taken for granted that all prisoners would behave well in his district prisons.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0123.wav|On that account he made no provision to insure safe custody,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0124.wav|thinking perhaps that prisoners so well disposed would cheerfully remain in jail of their own accord.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0125.wav|But an open farm of a thousand acres would have offered abundant chances of escape, which some at least would have attempted, probably with success.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0126.wav|The creation of an expensive staff for supervision,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0127.wav|or the still more costly process of walling in the whole farm, would have greatly added to the charges of these establishments.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0128.wav|I have lingered too long perhaps over Mr. Pearson's proposal, but some reference was indispensable to a scheme|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0129.wav|which marked the growth of public interest in prison affairs, and which was the germ of the new system|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0130.wav|since admirably developed in the convict prisons of this country.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0131.wav|Mr. Pearson and the committee of 1850 have the more claim on our consideration, because,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0132.wav|in the inquiry which followed, attention was again attracted to Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0133.wav|The condition of that prison in 1850 may be gathered from the pages of the report. Not much had been done to remedy the old defects;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0134.wav|radical improvement was generally considered impossible. The great evil, however, had been sensibly diminished.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0135.wav|There was no longer, or at worst but rarely, and for short periods, the same overcrowding.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0136.wav|This was obviated by the frequent sessions of the Central Criminal Court, and the utilization of the two subsidiary prisons in Giltspur Street and Southwark.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0137.wav|The prison population of Newgate was still subject to great fluctuations, but it seldom rose above two hundred and fifty or three hundred|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0138.wav|at the most crowded periods, or just before the sessional jail delivery; and at its lowest it fell sometimes to fifty or sixty.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0139.wav|These numbers would have still further decreased, and the jail would have been almost empty, but for the misdemeanants who were still sent to Newgate|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0140.wav|at times on long terms of imprisonment, and for the transports, whom the Home Office were often, as of old, slow to remove.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0141.wav|The old wards, day rooms and sleeping rooms combined, of which the reader has already heard so much,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0142.wav|now seldom contained more than ten or a dozen each. Some sort of decorum was maintained among the occupants in the day-time.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0143.wav|Drinking and gaming,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0144.wav|the indiscriminate visitation of friends, and the almost unlimited admission of extra food, these more glaring defects had disappeared.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0145.wav|But reformation was only skin deep. Below the surface many of the old evils still rankled.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0146.wav|There was as yet no control over the prisoners after locking-up time;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0147.wav|this occurred in summer at eight, but in the winter months it took place at dusk, and was often as early as four or five.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0148.wav|The prisoners were still left to themselves till next morning's unlocking,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0149.wav|and they spent some fourteen or fifteen hours in total darkness, and almost without check or control.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0150.wav|Captain Williams, who was the inspector of prisons for the home district in succession to Messrs. Crawford and Russell,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0151.wav|stated in evidence that he was visiting Newgate one night, when he heard a great disturbance in one of the day and sleeping rooms,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0152.wav|and on entering it found the prisoners engaged in kicking bundles of wood from one end of the ward to the other.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0153.wav|Some attempt at supervision was exercised by the night watchman stationed on the leads, who might hear what went on inside.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0154.wav|If any disturbance reached his ears, he reported the case to the governor, who next morning visited the ward in fault, and asked for the culprit.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0155.wav|The enforcement of discipline depended upon the want of honor among thieves.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0156.wav|Unless the guilty prisoner was given up, the whole ward was punished, either by the exclusion of visitors or the deprivation of fire,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0157.wav|sharp tests which generally broke down the fidelity of the inmates of the ward to one another.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0158.wav|Later on a more efficacious but still imperfect method of supervision was introduced. Iron cages, which are still to be seen in Newgate,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0159.wav|were constructed on the landings, ensconced in which warders spent the night, on duty, and alert to watch the sleepers below,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0160.wav|and check by remonstrance or threat of punishment all who broke the peace of the prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0161.wav|These disciplinary improvements were, however, only slowly and gradually introduced.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0162.wav|Other changes affecting the condition and proper treatment of prisoners were not made until the inspector had urged and recommended them.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0163.wav|Thus the wards, which, as I have said, were left in complete darkness, were now to be lighted with gas; and after this most salutary addition,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0164.wav|the personal superintendence of night officers, as already described, became possible.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0165.wav|The rule became general as regards the prison dress; hitherto clothing had been issued only to such as were destitute or in rags, and all classes of prisoners,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0166.wav|those for trial, and those sentenced for short terms or long|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0167.wav|wore no distinguishing costume, although its use was admitted, not only for cleanliness, but as a badge of condition, and a security against escape.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0168.wav|Renewed recommendations to provide employment resulted in the provision of a certain amount of oakum for picking,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0169.wav|and one or two men were allowed to mend clothes and make shoes. The rules made by the Secretary of State were hung up in conspicuous parts of the prison;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0170.wav|more officers were appointed, as the time of so many of those already on the staff was monopolized by attendance at the Central Criminal Court.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0171.wav|Another custom which had led to disorder was abolished;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0172.wav|prisoners who had been acquitted were not permitted to return to the prison to show their joy and receive the congratulations of their unfortunate fellows.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0173.wav|The Corporation seems to have introduced these salutary changes without hesitation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0174.wav|It was less prompt apparently in dealing with structural alterations and improvements.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0175.wav|Well-founded complaints had been made of the want of heating appliances in the jail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0176.wav|The wards had open fires, but the separate cells were not warmed at all.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0177.wav|A scheme for heating the whole prison with hot-water pipes, after the system now generally adopted elsewhere, was considered,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0178.wav|and abandoned because of the expense. As to the entire reconstruction of Newgate, nothing had been done as yet.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0179.wav|This, with a scheme for limiting the jail to untried prisoners, had been urgently recommended by Lord John Russell in 1830.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0180.wav|His letter to the Corporation, under date 4th June,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0181.wav|is an interesting document, and shows that even at that date the Government contemplated the erection of a model prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0182.wav|Lord John Russell, commenting upon the offer of the Corporation to improve Newgate,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0183.wav|provided it was henceforth used only for untried prisoners, suggested that Newgate should be entirely reconstructed, and the new building adopted as a model.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0184.wav|The Corporation had agreed to spend £20,000 on alterations, but £60,000 would suffice to reconstruct.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0185.wav|Lord John, with great fairness, admitted that the whole of this burthen could not be imposed upon the city|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0186.wav|seeing that since the establishment of the Central Criminal Court, Newgate received prisoners for trial from several counties,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0187.wav|and he was therefore prepared to submit to Parliament a proposal that half the cost of reconstruction should be borne by public funds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0188.wav|He forwarded plans prepared by the inspectors of prisons, not for blind adoption, but as a guide.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0189.wav|This plan was on the principle of cellular separation, a system, according to Lord John Russell, desirable in all prisons,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0190.wav|but in a metropolitan prison absolutely essential. The Corporation in reply demurred rather to accepting strict separation as a rule,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0191.wav|feeling that it approached too nearly to solitary confinement.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0192.wav|The court was, however, prepared to consider Lord John Russell's proposal with regard to the cost of rebuilding;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0193.wav|"but as the plan was ""confessedly experimental, for the benefit of the country generally, the amount for which the city should be responsible should be distinctly limited"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0194.wav|not to exceed a certain sum to be agreed upon.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0195.wav|A proviso was also made that the magistrates should continue to exercise full control over the new jail,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0196.wav|free from any other interference than that of the inspectors on the part of Government.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0197.wav|No doubt wiser counsels prevailed with Lord John Russell,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0198.wav|and on a more mature consideration he realized that the limited area of the existing Newgate site,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0199.wav|and the costliness of enlarging it, forbade all idea of entirely reconstructing the jail so as to constitute it a model prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0200.wav|It would be far better to begin at the beginning,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0201.wav|to select a sufficiently spacious piece of ground, and erect a prison which from foundations to roofs should be in conformity with the newest ideas.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0202.wav|The preference given to the Pentonville system destroyed all hopes of a complete reformation of Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0203.wav|"But the condition of the great city jail was evidently considered a reproach by the city authorities, and a year after the opening of the new ""model"" at Pentonville,"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0204.wav|a serious effort was made to reconstruct Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0205.wav|In 1845 the Jail Committee brought forward a definite proposal to purchase ground in the immediate vicinity for the erection of a new jail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0206.wav|This jail was nominally to replace the Giltspur Street Compter,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0207.wav|The site of which was to be sold to Christ's Hospital, but the intention was of course to embody and absorb old Newgate in the new construction.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0208.wav|The proposal made was to purchase some fifty thousand square feet between Newgate, Warwick Lane, and the Sessions House,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0209.wav|the situation having been proved by long experience to be salubrious.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0210.wav|But when this suggestion was brought before the court of aldermen, various amendments were proposed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0211.wav|It was urged that the area selected for purchase must be excessively costly to acquire, and still quite inadequate for the city needs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0212.wav|The Home Secretary had laid it down that at least five acres would be indispensable, and such an area it was impossible to obtain within the limits of the city.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0213.wav|Now for the first time the Tuffnell estate in Holloway was mentioned.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0214.wav|The Corporation owned lands there covering from nineteen to twenty acres.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0215.wav|Why not move the city prison bodily into this more rural spot, with its purer air and greater breathing space?|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0216.wav|Eventually Holloway was decided upon as a site for the new city prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0217.wav|The necessary preliminaries took some time, but the contracts for the new building were completed in 1849, when the works were commenced.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0218.wav|The prison was to contain four hundred and four prisoners, and the estimated expenditure was £79,000.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0219.wav|It was to accommodate only the convicted prisoners sentenced to terms short of penal servitude, and after its completion|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0220.wav|the uses of Newgate were narrowed almost entirely to those of a prison of detention.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0221.wav|It was intended as far as possible that, except awaiting trial, no prisoner should find himself relegated to Newgate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0222.wav|This principle became more and more generally the rule, although it has never been punctiliously observed. Now and again|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0223.wav|misdemeanants have found their way into Newgate, and within the last few years one offender against the privileges of the House of Commons.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0224.wav|With the reduction of numbers to be accommodated, there was ample space in Newgate for its reconstruction on the most approved modern lines.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0225.wav|In 1857|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0226.wav|the erection of a wing or large block of cells was commenced within the original walls of the prison, and upon the north or male side.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0227.wav|This block contained one hundred and thirty cells, embracing every modern improvement;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0228.wav|it also contained eleven reception cells, six punishment cells, and a couple of cells for condemned criminals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0229.wav|This block was completed in 1859, after which the hitherto unavoidable and long-continued promiscuous association of prisoners|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0230.wav|In 1861 a similar work was undertaken to provide separate cellular accommodation for the female inmates of Newgate,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0231.wav|and by the following year forty-seven new cells had been built on the most approved plan.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0232.wav|During this reconstruction the female prisoners were lodged in Holloway,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0233.wav|and when it was completed, both sides of the prison were brought into harmony with modern ideas.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0234.wav|The old buildings were entirely disused, and the whole of the inmates of Newgate were kept constantly in separate confinement.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0235.wav|With the last re-edification of Newgate, a work executed some seven centuries after the first stone of the old jail was laid,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0236.wav|the architectural records of the prison end. Nothing much was done at Newgate in the way of building, outside or in, after 1862.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0237.wav|The Act for private executions led to the erection of the gallows shed in the exercising yard, and at the flank of the passage from the condemned cells.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0238.wav|"The first ""glass house,"" or room in which prisoners could talk in private with their attorneys, but yet be seen by the warder on the watch, had been constructed"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0239.wav|and others were subsequently added.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0240.wav|But no structural alterations were made from the date first quoted until the time of closing the prison in 1881.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0241.wav|But in the interval very comprehensive and, I think it must be admitted, salutary changes were successively introduced into the management of prisons.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0242.wav|Newgate naturally shared in any advantages due to these reforms. I propose, therefore, to refer to them in the concluding pages of this work,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0243.wav|and thus bring the history of prison discipline down to our own times.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0244.wav|The last inquiry into the condition and management of our jails and houses of correction was that made by the Lords' Committee in 1863.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0245.wav|The inquiry was most searching and complete, and the committee spoke plainly in its report.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0246.wav|"It animadverted strongly on ""the many and wide differences as regards construction, labor, diet, and general discipline"""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0247.wav|which existed in the various prisons,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0248.wav|leading to an inequality, uncertainty, and inefficiency of punishment productive of the most prejudicial results.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0249.wav|The varieties in construction were still very marked.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0250.wav|In many prisons the prisoners were still associated, and, from the want of a sufficient number of cells, the principle of separation was still greatly neglected.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0251.wav|"Yet this principle, as the committee pointed out, ""must now be accepted as the foundation of prison discipline,"""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0252.wav|while its rigid maintenance was in its opinion vital to the efficiency of the jails.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0253.wav|Even where cells had been built|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0254.wav|they were frequently below the standard size, and were therefore not certified for occupation as was required by law.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0255.wav|Great numbers were not lighted at night, and were without means by which their inmates could communicate, in case of urgent necessity, with their keepers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0256.wav|Still greater were the differences with regard to employment. The various authorities held widely different opinions as to what constituted hard labor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0257.wav|Here the tread-wheel was in use, there cellular cranks, or hard-labor machines.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0258.wav|Both, however, varied greatly in mechanism and in the amount of energy they called forth,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0259.wav|while the former was intended for the congregate labor of a number, and the latter, as its name implies, imposed continuous solitary toil.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0260.wav|"At other prisons ""shot-drill,"" the lifting and carrying of heavy round shot, was the favorite method of inflicting penal labor."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0261.wav|With these differences were others as opposed concerning industrial occupation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0262.wav|The jail authorities often gave the highest, possibly undue, importance to the value of remunerative employment,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0263.wav|and sought to make profitable returns from prisoners' labor the test of prison efficiency. In this view the committee could not coincide,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0264.wav|and it was decidedly of opinion that in all short sentences the hard labor of the tread-wheel, crank, and so forth should be the invariable rule.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0265.wav|In dietaries, again, the same wide diversity of practice obtained.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0266.wav|The efforts made by Sir James Graham years before to introduce uniformity in this particular had failed of effect.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0267.wav|The Secretary of State's suggested scale of diet had seldom been closely followed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0268.wav|In some places the dietary was too full, in others too meager. Its constituents were not of the most suitable character.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0269.wav|More animal food was given than was necessary.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0270.wav|Vegetables, especially the potato, that most valuable anti-scorbutic, was too often omitted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0271.wav|In a word, the value of diet as a part of penal discipline was still insufficiently recognized.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0272.wav|The prisons were still far from inflicting the three punishments, hard labor, hard fare, and a hard bed|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0273.wav|which Sir Joshua Jebb told the committee he considered the proper elements of penal discipline.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0274.wav|It is interesting to note here|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0275.wav|"that the committee of 1863 fully endorsed Sir Joshua's recommendations as regards a ""hard bed,"" and recommended that"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0276.wav|during short sentences, or the earlier stages of a long confinement,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0277.wav|the prisoners should be made to dispense with the use of a mattress, and should sleep on planks.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0278.wav|This suggestion was adopted in the Act of 1865, which followed the committee's report, and of which more directly.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0279.wav|Clause 92, Schedule 1 of that act authorized the use of plank beds, which were adopted in many prisons.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0280.wav|They are now the universal rule,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0281.wav|introduced, as was erroneously supposed, by the prison commissioners appointed under the Prison Act of 1877.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0282.wav|Their origin it will be seen dates back much further than that.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0283.wav|Beds might well be made hard and their use strictly limited.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0284.wav|According to this committee of 1863, beds in the smaller and most carelessly conducted prisons formed a large element in the life of a prisoner.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0285.wav|In one jail fifteen hours were spent in bed out of the twenty-four. This was in keeping with other grave defects and omissions.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0286.wav|The minor borough prisons were the worst blot on the still dark and imperfect system.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0287.wav|They were very numerous, very imperfect in construction and management, and they were very little required.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0288.wav|In them, according to the committee, the old objectionable practices were still in full force.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0289.wav|There was unrestrained association of untried and convicted, juvenile with adult prisoners, vagrants, misdemeanants, felons.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0290.wav|There were dormitories without light, control, or regulation at night,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0291.wav|which warders, dreading assault, were afraid to enter after dark, even to check rioting and disturbance.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0292.wav|Prisoners still slept two in a bed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0293.wav|In one prison the bedsteads had been removed lest the prisoners should break them up and convert them into weapons of offense.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0294.wav|The prison buildings were in many places out of repair; other houses often overlooked them.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0295.wav|A single officer was the only custodian and disciplinary authority in the jail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0296.wav|Complete idleness was tolerated; there was neither penal labor nor light employment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0297.wav|The prisoners inter-communicated freely, and exercised the most injurious, corrupting influences upon one another.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0298.wav|The total want of administration was very marked,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0299.wav|but in one prison it was such that the prisoners' food was supplied daily from the neighboring inn, and the innkeeper's bill constituted the only accounts kept.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0300.wav|The committee might well suggest the abolition of these jails, or their amalgamation with the larger county establishments in their immediate neighborhood.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0301.wav|Some idea of the comparative uselessness of these small borough prisons was conveyed by some figures quoted by the committee.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0302.wav|In 1862 there were in all one hundred and ninety-three jails in England and Wales;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0303.wav|of these, sixty-three gave admittance during the entire year to less than twenty-five prisoners;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0304.wav|twenty-two others received between eleven and twenty-five;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0305.wav|fourteen received less than eleven and more than six;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0306.wav|while twenty-seven received less than six prisoners, and were in some instances absolutely tenantless.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0307.wav|The result of the recommendation of the committee of 1862 was the Prison Act of 1865,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0308.wav|the penultimate of such enactments, many of the provisions of which still remain in force.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0309.wav|The main object of this act was to compass that uniformity in discipline and treatment generally|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0310.wav|which had long been admitted as indispensable, and had never as yet been properly obtained.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0311.wav|The legislature was beginning to overcome its disinclination to interfere actively or authoritatively|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0312.wav|with the local jurisdictions, although still very leniently disposed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0313.wav|However, it now laid down in plain language and with precise details the requirements of a good jail system.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0314.wav|The separation of prisoners in cells duly certified by the inspectors was insisted upon,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0315.wav|also their constant employment in labor appropriate to their condition.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0316.wav|Hard labor of the first and second class was carefully defined.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0317.wav|The former, which consisted principally of the tread-wheel, cranks, capstans, shot-drill,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0318.wav|was to be the rule for all convicted prisoners throughout the early stages of their detention;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0319.wav|while the latter, which included various forms of industrial employment,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0320.wav|was the boon to which willing industry extending over a long period established a certain claim.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0321.wav|The infliction of punishment more or less uniform was thus aimed at.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0322.wav|On the other hand, new and careful regulations were framed to secure the moral and material well-being of the inmates of the jails.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0323.wav|The law made it imperative that every prison should have a prison chapel, and that daily and Sunday services should be held.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0324.wav|The chaplain's duties were enlarged, and the principle of toleration accepted to the extent of securing to all prisoners|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0325.wav|the ministrations of ministers of their own form of belief.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0326.wav|Steps were taken to provide the illiterate with secular instruction.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0327.wav|No less close was the care as regards preservation of health.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0328.wav|Stringent rules were prescribed for the prison surgeons;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0329.wav|every prison was ordered to keep up an infirmary, and the medical supervision was to be strict and continuous.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0330.wav|Dietaries were drawn up for adoption on the recommendation of a committee of experts.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0331.wav|Baths were provided, ablutions ordered, and all appliances to insure personal cleanliness.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0332.wav|The administration of good government was to be watched over by the local magistracy, certain of whom, styled visiting justices,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0333.wav|were elected to inspect the prisons frequently, to examine the prisoners, hear complaints, and check abuses.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0334.wav|Under them the governor or jailer was held strictly responsible.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0335.wav|The books and journals he was to keep were minutely specified, and his constant presence in or near the jail was insisted upon.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0336.wav|His disciplinary powers were defined by the act, and his duties,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0337.wav|both in controlling his subordinates and in protecting the prisoners from petty tyranny and oppression, every one of whom he was to see once every twenty-four hours.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0338.wav|But discipline was to be maintained if necessary by punishment,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0339.wav|while decency and good order were to be insured by the strict prohibition of gambling and drunkenness.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0340.wav|The latter was rendered nearly impossible by the penalties imposed on persons bringing spirituous liquors into the jail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0341.wav|The old custom, so fruitful of the worst evils, of keeping a tap inside the prison was made illegal.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0342.wav|So was the employment of prisoners in any position of trust or authority;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0343.wav|they were not to be turnkeys or assistant turnkeys, neither wardsman nor yardsman, overseer,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0344.wav|monitor, or schoolmaster, nor to be engaged in the service of any officer of the prison.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0345.wav|"The Act of 1865 also encouraged and empowered the local authorities to ""alter, enlarge, or rebuild"" their prisons."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0346.wav|They might raise funds for this purpose, provided a certificate for the necessity for the new works was given, either by the recorder|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0347.wav|chairman of quarter sessions, or even by a couple of justices.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0348.wav|Every facility was promised. The sanction of the Secretary of State would not be withheld if plans and estimates were duly submitted,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0349.wav|and they met with the approval of his professional adviser, the surveyor-general of prisons.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0350.wav|The funds necessary would be advanced by the Public Works Loan Commissioners, and the interest might be charged against the county or borough rates.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0351.wav|Nor were these the only inducements offered. Where local authorities were indisposed to set their prisons in order,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0352.wav|or hesitated to embark upon any considerable expenditure to alter or rebuild,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0353.wav|they were at liberty to hire suitable cell accommodation from any neighbors who might have it to spare; the only proviso,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0354.wav|That no such contract was valid between one jurisdiction and another unless the Secretary of State was satisfied that the prison it was intended to use|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0355.wav|came up in all respects to modern requirements.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0356.wav|But the act was not limited to permissive legislation. Its provisions and enactments were backed up by certain penalties.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0357.wav|"The Secretary of State was empowered to deal rather summarily with ""inadequate"" prisons, in other words,"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0358.wav|with those in which there was no separation, no proper enforcement of hard labor, no chapel, infirmary, and so forth.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0359.wav|He could in the first place withhold the government grant in aid of prison funds by refusing the certificate to the Treasury upon which the allowance was paid.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0360.wav|This he might do on the representation of the inspector of prisons,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0361.wav|who was bound to report any deficiencies and abuses he might find at his periodical visits. The Secretary of State might go further.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0362.wav|Where the local authority had neglected to comply with the provisions of the 1865 Act for four consecutive years,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0363.wav|"he could close the ""inadequate"" prison, by declaring it unfit for the reception of prisoners."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0364.wav|His order would at the same time specify some neighboring and more satisfactory prison which the local authority would be compelled to utilize instead,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0365.wav|and with the concurrence of the other authority, and on payment. A few provisos governed these rather extensive powers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0366.wav|It was necessary, for instance, to give due notice when the government grant was to be withdrawn,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0367.wav|and with the warning a copy of the particular defects and allegations was to be sent to the local authority.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0006.wav|have had to do with industry and labor and with respect to these, certain developments have taken place which I consider of importance.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0007.wav|I am happy to report that after years of uncertainty, culminating in the collapse of the spring of 1933,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0008.wav|we are bringing order out of the old chaos|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0009.wav|with a greater certainty of the employment of labor at a reasonable wage and of more business at a fair profit.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0010.wav|These governmental and industrial developments hold promise of new achievements for the nation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0011.wav|Men may differ as to the particular form of governmental activity|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0012.wav|with respect to industry and business, but nearly all are agreed that private enterprise in times such as these|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0014.wav|but also our processes of civilization.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0015.wav|The underlying necessity for such activity|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0016.wav|is indeed as strong now as it was years ago when Elihu Root said the following very significant words:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0017.wav|Instead of the give and take of free individual contract,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0018.wav|the tremendous power of organization has combined great aggregations of capital in enormous industrial establishments|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0019.wav|working through vast agencies of commerce and employing great masses of men in movements of production|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0020.wav|and transportation and trade, so great in the mass that each individual concerned in them is quite helpless by himself.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0021.wav|The relations between the employer and the employed, between the owners of aggregated capital and the units of organized labor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0022.wav|between the small producer, the small trader, the consumer,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0023.wav|and the great transporting and manufacturing and distributing agencies,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0024.wav|all present new questions for the solution of which the old reliance upon the free action of individual wills appears quite inadequate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0025.wav|And in many directions, the intervention of that organized control which we call government|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0026.wav|seems necessary to produce the same result of justice and right conduct|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0027.wav|which obtained through the attrition of individuals before the new conditions arose.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0028.wav|It was in this spirit thus described by Secretary Root|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0029.wav|that we approached our task of reviving private enterprise in March, 1933.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0030.wav|Our first problem was, of course, the banking situation because, as you know, the banks had collapsed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0031.wav|Some banks could not be saved but the great majority of them, either through their own resources or with government aid,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0032.wav|have been restored to complete public confidence.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0033.wav|This has given safety to millions of depositors in these banks.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0034.wav|Closely following this great constructive effort we have, through various federal agencies,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0035.wav|saved debtors and creditors alike in many other fields of enterprise, such as loans on farm mortgages and home mortgages;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0036.wav|loans to the railroads and insurance companies and, finally, help for home owners and industry itself.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0037.wav|In all of these efforts the government has come to the assistance of business|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0038.wav|and with the full expectation that the money used to assist these enterprises will eventually be repaid.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0039.wav|I believe it will be.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0040.wav|The second step we have taken in the restoration of normal business enterprise|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0041.wav|has been to clean up thoroughly unwholesome conditions in the field of investment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0042.wav|In this we have had assistance from many bankers and businessmen,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0043.wav|most of whom recognize the past evils in the banking system, in the sale of securities, in the deliberate encouragement of stock gambling,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0044.wav|in the sale of unsound mortgages and in many other ways in which the public lost billions of dollars.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0045.wav|They saw that without changes in the policies and methods of investment|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0046.wav|there could be no recovery of public confidence in the security of savings.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0047.wav|The country now enjoys the safety of bank savings under the new banking laws,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0048.wav|the careful checking of new securities under the Securities Act|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0049.wav|and the curtailment of rank stock speculation through the Securities Exchange Act.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0050.wav|I sincerely hope that as a result|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0051.wav|people will be discouraged in unhappy efforts to get rich quick by speculating in securities.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0052.wav|The average person almost always loses.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0053.wav|Only a very small minority of the people of this country believe in gambling as a substitute for the old philosophy of Benjamin Franklin|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0054.wav|that the way to wealth is through work.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0055.wav|In meeting the problems of industrial recovery the chief agency of the government has been the National Recovery Administration.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0056.wav|Under its guidance, trades and industries covering over 90 percent of all industrial employees|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0057.wav|have adopted codes of fair competition, which have been approved by the President.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0058.wav|Under these codes, in the industries covered, child labor has been eliminated.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0059.wav|The work day and the work week have been shortened.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0060.wav|Minimum wages have been established and other wages adjusted toward a rising standard of living.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0061.wav|The emergency purpose of the N.R.A. was to put men to work and since its creation more than four million persons have been reemployed,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0062.wav|in great part through the cooperation of American business brought about under the codes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0063.wav|Benefits of the Industrial Recovery Program have come,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0064.wav|not only to labor in the form of new jobs, in relief from overwork and in relief from underpay,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0065.wav|but also to the owners and managers of industry because,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0066.wav|together with a great increase in the payrolls, there has come a substantial rise in the total of industrial profits|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0067.wav|a rise from a deficit figure in the first quarter of 1933|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0068.wav|to a level of sustained profits within one year from the inauguration of N.R.A.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0069.wav|Now it should not be expected that even employed labor and capital would be completely satisfied with present conditions.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0070.wav|Employed workers have not by any means all enjoyed a return to the earnings of prosperous times,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0071.wav|although millions of hitherto underprivileged workers are today far better paid than ever before.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0072.wav|Also, billions of dollars of invested capital have today a greater security of present and future earning power than before.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0073.wav|This is because of the establishment of fair, competitive standards and because of relief from unfair competition|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0074.wav|in wage cutting which depresses markets and destroys purchasing power.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0075.wav|But it is an undeniable fact that the restoration of other billions of sound investments to a reasonable earning power|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0076.wav|could not be brought about in one year.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0077.wav|There is no magic formula,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0078.wav|no economic panacea, which could simply revive over-night the heavy industries and the trades dependent upon them.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0079.wav|Nevertheless the gains of trade and industry, as a whole, have been substantial.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0080.wav|In these gains and in the policies of the administration there are assurances that hearten all forward- looking men and women|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0081.wav|with the confidence that we are definitely rebuilding our political and economic system on the lines laid down by the New Deal|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0082.wav|lines which as I have so often made clear, are in complete accord with the underlying principles of orderly popular government|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0083.wav|which Americans have demanded since the white man first came to these shores.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0084.wav|We count, in the future as in the past, on the driving power of individual initiative|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0085.wav|and the incentive of fair private profit,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0086.wav|strengthened with the acceptance of those obligations to the public interest which rest upon us all.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0087.wav|We have the right to expect that this driving power will be given patriotically and whole-heartedly to our nation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0088.wav|We have passed through the formative period of code making in the National Recovery Administration|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0089.wav|and have effected a reorganization of the N.R.A.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0090.wav|suited to the needs of the next phase, which is, in turn, a period of preparation for legislation which will determine its permanent form.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0091.wav|In this recent reorganization we have recognized three distinct functions:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0092.wav|first, the legislative or policy making function;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0093.wav|second, the administrative function of code making and revision; and, third, the judicial function, which includes enforcement,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0094.wav|consumer complaints and the settlement of disputes between employers and employees and between one employer and another.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0095.wav|We are now prepared to move into this second phase, on the basis of our experience in the first phase|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0096.wav|under the able and energetic leadership of General Johnson.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0097.wav|we shall watch carefully the working of this new machinery for the second phase of N.R.A.,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0098.wav|modifying it where it needs modification and finally making recommendations to the Congress,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0099.wav|in order that the functions of N.R.A. which have proved their worth may be made a part of the permanent machinery of government.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0100.wav|Let me call your attention to the fact that the national Industrial Recovery Act|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0101.wav|gave businessmen the opportunity they had sought for years to improve business conditions through what has been called self-government in industry.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0102.wav|If the codes which have been written have been too complicated,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0103.wav|if they have gone too far in such matters as price fixing and limitation of production,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0104.wav|let it be remembered that so far as possible, consistent with the immediate public interest of this past year|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0105.wav|and the vital necessity of improving labor conditions,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0106.wav|the representatives of trade and industry were permitted to write their ideas into the codes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0107.wav|It is now time to review these actions as a whole to determine through deliberative means in the light of experience,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0108.wav|from the standpoint of the good of the industries themselves, as well as the general public interest,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0109.wav|whether the methods and policies adopted in the emergency|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0110.wav|have been best calculated to promote industrial recovery and a permanent improvement of business and labor conditions.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0111.wav|There may be a serious question as to the wisdom of many of those devices to control production,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0112.wav|or to prevent destructive price cutting which many business organizations have insisted were necessary,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0113.wav|or whether their effect may have been to prevent that volume of production which would make possible lower prices and increased employment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0114.wav|Another question arises as to whether in fixing minimum wages on the basis of an hourly or weekly wage|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0115.wav|we have reached into the heart of the problem which is to provide such annual earnings for the lowest paid worker as will meet his minimum needs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0116.wav|We also question the wisdom of extending code requirements suited to the great industrial centers and to large employers,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0117.wav|to the great number of small employers in the smaller communities.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0118.wav|During the last twelve months our industrial recovery has been to some extent retarded by strikes,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0119.wav|including a few of major importance.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0120.wav|I would not minimize the inevitable losses to employers and employees and to the general public through such conflicts.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0121.wav|But I would point out that the extent and severity of labor disputes during this period|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0122.wav|has been far less than in any previous, comparable period.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0123.wav|When the businessmen of the country were demanding the right to organize themselves adequately to promote their legitimate interests;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0124.wav|when the farmers were demanding legislation which would give them opportunities and incentives to organize themselves for a common advance,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0125.wav|it was natural that the workers should seek and obtain a statutory declaration of their constitutional right|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0126.wav|to organize themselves for collective bargaining as embodied in Section 7 (a) of the national Industrial Recovery Act.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0128.wav|Both employers and employees must share the blame of not using them as fully as they should.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0129.wav|The employer who turns away from impartial agencies of peace,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0130.wav|who denies freedom of organization to his employees, or fails to make every reasonable effort at a peaceful solution of their differences,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0131.wav|is not fully supporting the recovery effort of his government.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0132.wav|The workers who turn away from these same impartial agencies and decline to use their good offices to gain their ends|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0133.wav|are likewise not fully cooperating with their government.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0134.wav|It is time that we made a clean-cut effort to bring about that united action of management and labor,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0138.wav|with justice for all those willing to use these agencies whenever their voluntary bargaining fails to produce a necessary agreement.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0139.wav|There should be at least a full and fair trial given to these means of ending industrial warfare;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0140.wav|and in such an effort we should be able to secure for employers and employees and consumers|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0141.wav|the benefits that all derive from the continuous, peaceful operation of our essential enterprises.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0142.wav|Accordingly, I propose to confer within the coming month|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0143.wav|with small groups of those truly representative of large employers of labor and of large groups of organized labor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0144.wav|in order to seek their cooperation in establishing what I may describe as a specific trial period of industrial peace.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0145.wav|From those willing to join in establishing this hoped-for period of peace,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0146.wav|I shall seek assurances of the making and maintenance of agreements, which can be mutually relied upon,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0147.wav|under which wages, hours and working conditions|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0148.wav|may be determined and any later adjustments shall be made either by agreement or, in case of disagreement,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0149.wav|through the mediation or arbitration of state or federal agencies.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0150.wav|I shall not ask either employers or employees permanently to lay aside the weapons common to industrial war.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0151.wav|But I shall ask both groups to give a fair trial to peaceful methods of adjusting their conflicts of opinion and interest,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0152.wav|and to experiment for a reasonable time with measures suitable to civilize our industrial civilization.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0155.wav|both directly on the public works themselves, and indirectly in the industries supplying the materials for these public works.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0166.wav|we must make it a national principle that we will not tolerate a large army of unemployed and that we will arrange our national economy|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0167.wav|to end our present unemployment as soon as we can and then to take wise measures against its return.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0203.wav|The course we have followed fits the American practice of government -- a practice of taking action step by step,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0041.wav|Its first objective is to put men and women now on the relief rolls to work and, incidentally,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0042.wav|to assist materially in our already unmistakable march toward recovery.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0043.wav|I shall not confuse my discussion by a multitude of figures. So many figures are quoted to prove so many things.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0046.wav|It is true that while business and industry are definitely better our relief rolls are still too large.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0047.wav|However, for the first time in five years the relief rolls have declined instead of increased during the winter months.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0048.wav|They are still declining.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0049.wav|The simple fact is that many million more people have private work today than two years ago today or one year ago today,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0050.wav|and every day that passes offers more chances to work for those who want to work.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0051.wav|In spite of the fact that unemployment remains a serious problem|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0052.wav|here as in every other nation, we have come to recognize the possibility and the necessity of certain helpful remedial measures.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0053.wav|These measures are of two kinds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0054.wav|The first is to make provisions intended to relieve, to minimize, and to prevent future unemployment;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0055.wav|the second is to establish the practical means to help those who are unemployed in this present emergency.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0056.wav|Our social security legislation is an attempt to answer the first of these questions; our Works Relief program, the second.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0057.wav|The program for social security now pending before the Congress is a necessary part of the future unemployment policy of the government.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0058.wav|While our present and projected expenditures for work relief are wholly within the reasonable limits of our national credit resources,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0059.wav|it is obvious that we cannot continue to create governmental deficits for that purpose year after year.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0060.wav|We must begin now to make provision for the future.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0061.wav|That is why our social security program is an important part of the complete picture.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0062.wav|It proposes, by means of old age pensions,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0063.wav|to help those who have reached the age of retirement to give up their jobs and thus give to the younger generation greater opportunities for work|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0067.wav|but it will, by sustaining purchasing power, cushion the shock of economic distress.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0068.wav|Another helpful feature of unemployment insurance is the incentive it will give to employers to plan more carefully|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0069.wav|in order that unemployment may be prevented by the stabilizing of employment itself.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0070.wav|Provisions for social security, however, are protections for the future.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0071.wav|Our responsibility for the immediate necessities of the unemployed has been met by the Congress|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0072.wav|through the most comprehensive work plan in the history of the nation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0073.wav|Our problem is to put to work three and one-half million employable persons now on the relief rolls.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0074.wav|It is a problem quite as much for private industry as for the government.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0075.wav|We are losing no time getting the government's vast work relief program underway,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0076.wav|and we have every reason to believe that it should be in full swing by autumn.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0077.wav|In directing it, I shall recognize six fundamental principles:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0078.wav|1. The projects should be useful.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0079.wav|Projects shall be of a nature that a considerable proportion of the money spent will go into wages for labor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0080.wav|Projects will be sought which promise ultimate return to the federal treasury of a considerable proportion of the costs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0081.wav|Funds allotted for each project should be actually and promptly spent and not held over until later years.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0082.wav|In all cases projects must be of a character to give employment to those on the relief rolls.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0083.wav|6. Projects will be allocated to localities or relief areas in relation to the number of workers on relief rolls in those areas.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0084.wav|I next want to make it clear exactly how we shall direct the work.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0085.wav|I have set up a Division of Applications and Information|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0086.wav|to which all proposals for the expenditure of money must go for preliminary study and consideration.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0087.wav|After the Division of Applications and Information has sifted those projects,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0088.wav|they will be sent to an Allotment Division composed of representatives of the more important governmental agencies|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0089.wav|charged with carrying on work relief projects.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0090.wav|The group will also include representatives of cities, and of labor, farming, banking and industry.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0091.wav|This Allotment Division will consider all of the recommendations submitted to it|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0092.wav|and such projects as they approve will be next submitted to the President who under the Act is required to make final allocations.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0093.wav|The next step will be to notify the proper government agency|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0094.wav|in whose field the project falls, and also to notify another agency which I am creating -- a Progress Division.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0095.wav|This Division will have the duty of coordinating the purchases of materials and supplies|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0096.wav|and of making certain that people who are employed will be taken from the relief rolls.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0097.wav|It will also have the responsibility of determining work payments in various localities,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0098.wav|of making full use of existing employment services and to assist people engaged in relief work|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0099.wav|to move as rapidly as possible back into private employment when such employment is available.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0100.wav|Moreover, this Division will be charged with keeping projects moving on schedule.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0101.wav|I have felt it to be essentially wise and prudent to avoid, so far as possible,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0102.wav|the creation of new governmental machinery for supervising this work.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0103.wav|The national government now has at least sixty different agencies with the staff|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0104.wav|and the experience and the competence necessary to carry on the two hundred and fifty or three hundred kinds of work that will be undertaken.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0105.wav|These agencies, therefore, will simply be doing on a somewhat enlarged scale the same sort of things that they have been doing.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0106.wav|This will make certain that the largest possible portion of the funds allotted|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0107.wav|will be spent for actually creating new work and not for building up expensive overhead organizations here in Washington.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0108.wav|For many months preparations have been under way.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0109.wav|The allotment of funds for desirable projects has already begun.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0110.wav|The key men for the major responsibilities of this great task already have been selected.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0112.wav|and I assure my fellow citizens that no energy will be spared in using these funds effectively|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0113.wav|to make a major attack upon the problem of unemployment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0114.wav|Our responsibility is to all of the people in this country.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0115.wav|This is a great national crusade to destroy enforced idleness which is an enemy of the human spirit|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0117.wav|Our attack upon these enemies must be without stint and without discrimination.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0118.wav|No sectional, no political distinctions can be permitted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0119.wav|It must, however, be recognized that when an enterprise of this character is extended over more than three thousand counties throughout the nation,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0120.wav|there may be occasional instances of inefficiency, bad management, or misuse of funds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0121.wav|When cases of this kind occur,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0122.wav|there will be those, of course, who will try to tell you that the exceptional failure is characteristic of the entire endeavor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0123.wav|It should be remembered that in every big job there are some imperfections.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0125.wav|every profession has its black sheep, but long experience in government has taught me|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0126.wav|that the exceptional instances of wrong-doing in government are probably less numerous than in almost every other line of endeavor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0127.wav|The most effective means of preventing such evils in this Works Relief program will be the eternal vigilance of the American people themselves.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0129.wav|in making this the most efficient and the cleanest example of public enterprise the world has ever seen.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0130.wav|It is time to provide a smashing answer for those cynical men who say that a democracy cannot be honest and efficient.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0150.wav|to eliminate so far as humanly possible, the kinds of unfair practices by selfish minorities which unfortunately|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0151.wav|did more than anything else to bring about the recent collapse of industries.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0152.wav|There is likewise pending before the Congress|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0153.wav|legislation to provide for the elimination of unnecessary holding companies in the public utility field.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0154.wav|I consider this legislation a positive recovery measure.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0161.wav|Even more significantly it has given the country as a whole an uneasy apprehension of overconcentrated economic power.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0177.wav|is one of the most hopeful results of our efforts as a Nation to reestablish public confidence in private banking.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0185.wav|The answer to this demand was the Federal Reserve System.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0007.wav|I am reminded of that evening in March, four years ago, when I made my first radio report to you.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0008.wav|We were then in the midst of the great banking crisis.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0010.wav|we asked the nation to turn over all of its privately held gold, dollar for dollar, to the government of the United States.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0011.wav|Today's recovery proves how right that policy was.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0012.wav|But when, almost two years later, it came before the Supreme Court its constitutionality was upheld only by a five-to-four vote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0013.wav|The change of one vote would have thrown all the affairs of this great Nation back into hopeless chaos.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0015.wav|to exact a pound of flesh was more sacred than the main objectives of the Constitution to establish an enduring Nation.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0018.wav|We also became convinced that the only way to avoid a repetition of those dark days was to have a government with power to prevent|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0019.wav|and to cure the abuses and the inequalities which had thrown that system out of joint.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0020.wav|We then began a program of remedying those abuses and inequalities -- to give balance and stability to our economic system|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0021.wav|to make it bomb-proof against the causes of 1929.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0023.wav|and recovery is speeding up to a point where the dangers of 1929 are again becoming possible,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0024.wav|not this week or month perhaps, but within a year or two.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0025.wav|National laws are needed to complete that program.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0026.wav|Individual or local or state effort alone cannot protect us in 1937 any better than ten years ago.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0027.wav|It will take time -- and plenty of time -- to work out our remedies administratively even after legislation is passed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0028.wav|To complete our program of protection in time, therefore,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0029.wav|we cannot delay one moment in making certain that our national government has power to carry through.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0030.wav|Four years ago action did not come until the eleventh hour.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0031.wav|It was almost too late.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0032.wav|If we learned anything from the depression|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0033.wav|we will not allow ourselves to run around in new circles of futile discussion and debate, always postponing the day of decision.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0034.wav|The American people have learned from the depression.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0035.wav|For in the last three national elections|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0036.wav|an overwhelming majority of them voted a mandate that the Congress and the President begin the task of providing that protection|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0037.wav|not after long years of debate, but now.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0038.wav|The courts, however, have cast doubts on the ability of the elected Congress to protect us against catastrophe|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0040.wav|We are at a crisis in our ability to proceed with that protection.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0041.wav|It is a quiet crisis. There are no lines of depositors outside closed banks.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0042.wav|But to the far-sighted it is far-reaching in its possibilities of injury to America.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0043.wav|I want to talk with you very simply about the need for present action in this crisis|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0044.wav|the need to meet the unanswered challenge of one-third of a Nation ill-nourished, ill-clad, ill-housed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0045.wav|Last Thursday I described the American form of government as a three horse team provided by the Constitution to the American people|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0046.wav|so that their field might be plowed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0047.wav|The three horses are, of course, the three branches of government -- the Congress, the Executive and the courts.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0048.wav|Two of the horses are pulling in unison today; the third is not.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0049.wav|Those who have intimated that the President of the United States is trying to drive that team|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0050.wav|overlook the simple fact that the President, as Chief Executive, is himself one of the three horses.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0051.wav|It is the American people themselves who are in the driver's seat.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0052.wav|It is the American people themselves who want the furrow plowed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0053.wav|It is the American people themselves who expect the third horse to pull in unison with the other two.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0054.wav|I hope that you have re-read the Constitution of the United States in these past few weeks.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0055.wav|Like the Bible, it ought to be read again and again.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0056.wav|It is an easy document to understand when you remember that it was called into being|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0057.wav|because the Articles of Confederation under which the original thirteen States tried to operate after the Revolution|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0058.wav|showed the need of a national government with power enough to handle national problems.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0059.wav|In its Preamble, the Constitution states that it was intended to form a more perfect Union and promote the general welfare;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0060.wav|and the powers given to the Congress to carry out those purposes can be best described by saying|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0061.wav|that they were all the powers needed to meet each and every problem which then had a national character|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0062.wav|and which could not be met by merely local action.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0063.wav|But the framers went further.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0064.wav|Having in mind that in succeeding generations many other problems then undreamed of would become national problems|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0065.wav|"they gave to the Congress the ample broad powers ""to levy taxes"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0066.wav|and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0067.wav|That, my friends, is what I honestly believe|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0068.wav|to have been the clear and underlying purpose of the patriots who wrote a federal constitution to create a national government|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0069.wav|"with national power, intended as they said, ""to form a more perfect union"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0070.wav|for ourselves and our posterity.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0071.wav|For nearly twenty years there was no conflict between the Congress and the Court.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0072.wav|Congress passed a statute which, in 1803, the Court said violated an express provision of the Constitution.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0073.wav|The Court claimed the power to declare it unconstitutional and did so declare it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0074.wav|But a little later the Court itself admitted|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0075.wav|that it was an extraordinary power to exercise and through Mr. Justice Washington laid down this limitation upon it:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0076.wav|It is but a decent respect due to the wisdom, the integrity and the patriotism of the legislative body,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0077.wav|by which any law is passed,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0078.wav|to presume in favor of its validity until its violation of the Constitution is proved beyond all reasonable doubt.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0079.wav|But since the rise of the modern movement for social and economic progress through legislation,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0080.wav|the Court has more and more often and more and more boldly|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0081.wav|asserted a power to veto laws passed by the Congress and state legislatures in complete disregard of this original limitation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0082.wav|In the last four years the sound rule of giving statutes the benefit of all reasonable doubt has been cast aside.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0083.wav|The Court has been acting not as a judicial body, but as a policy-making body.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0084.wav|When the Congress has sought to stabilize national agriculture, to improve the conditions of labor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0085.wav|to safeguard business against unfair competition,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0086.wav|to protect our national resources, and in many other ways, to serve our clearly national needs,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0087.wav|the majority of the Court has been assuming the power to pass on the wisdom of these acts of the Congress|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0088.wav|and to approve or disapprove the public policy written into these laws.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0089.wav|That is not only my accusation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0090.wav|It is the accusation of most distinguished justices of the present Supreme Court.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0091.wav|I have not the time to quote to you all the language used by dissenting justices in many of these cases.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0092.wav|But in the case holding the Railroad Retirement Act unconstitutional, for instance,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0093.wav|"Chief Justice Hughes said in a dissenting opinion that the majority opinion was ""a departure from sound principles,"""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0094.wav|"and placed ""an unwarranted limitation upon the commerce clause."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0095.wav|And three other justices agreed with him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0096.wav|In the case of holding the A.A.A. unconstitutional,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0097.wav|"Justice Stone said of the majority opinion that it was a ""tortured construction of the Constitution."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0098.wav|And two other justices agreed with him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0099.wav|In the case holding the New York Minimum Wage Law unconstitutional, Justice Stone said|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0100.wav|"that the majority were actually reading into the Constitution their own ""personal economic predilections,"" and that"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0101.wav|if the legislative power is not left free to choose the methods of solving the problems of poverty,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0102.wav|subsistence, and health of large numbers in the community, then|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0103.wav|government is to be rendered impotent.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0104.wav|And two other justices agreed with him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0105.wav|In the face of these dissenting opinions, there is no basis for the claim made by some members of the Court|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0106.wav|that something in the Constitution has compelled them regretfully to thwart the will of the people.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0107.wav|In the face of such dissenting opinions, it is perfectly clear that, as Chief Justice Hughes has said,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0108.wav|We are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0109.wav|The Court in addition to the proper use of its judicial functions has improperly set itself up as a third house of the Congress|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0110.wav|a super-legislature, as one of the justices has called it|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0111.wav|reading into the Constitution words and implications which are not there, and which were never intended to be there.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0112.wav|We have, therefore,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0113.wav|reached the point as a nation where we must take action to save the Constitution from the Court and the Court from itself.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0114.wav|We must find a way to take an appeal from the Supreme Court to the Constitution itself.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0115.wav|We want a Supreme Court which will do justice under the Constitution -- not over it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0116.wav|In our courts we want a government of laws and not of men.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0117.wav|I want -- as all Americans want -- an independent judiciary as proposed by the framers of the Constitution.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0118.wav|That means a Supreme Court that will enforce the Constitution as written|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0119.wav|that will refuse to amend the Constitution by the arbitrary exercise of judicial power -- amended by judicial say-so.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0120.wav|It does not mean a judiciary so independent that it can deny the existence of facts which are universally recognized.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0121.wav|How then could we proceed to perform the mandate given us?|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0122.wav|It was said in last year's Democratic platform,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0123.wav|If these problems cannot be effectively solved within the Constitution,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0124.wav|we shall seek such clarifying amendment as will assure the power to enact those laws,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0125.wav|adequately to regulate commerce, protect public health and safety, and safeguard economic security.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0126.wav|In other words, we said we would seek an amendment only if every other possible means by legislation were to fail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0127.wav|When I commenced to review the situation with the problem squarely before me,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0128.wav|I came by a process of elimination to the conclusion that, short of amendments,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0129.wav|the only method which was clearly constitutional, and would at the same time carry out other much needed reforms,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0130.wav|was to infuse new blood into all our courts.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0131.wav|We must have men worthy and equipped to carry out impartial justice.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0132.wav|But, at the same time, we must have judges who will bring to the courts a present-day sense of the Constitution|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0133.wav|judges who will retain in the courts the judicial functions of a court,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0134.wav|and reject the legislative powers which the courts have today assumed.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0007.wav|with the approval, as required by the Constitution, of the Senate of the United States.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0008.wav|That plan has two chief purposes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0009.wav|By bringing into the judicial system a steady and continuing stream of new and younger blood, I hope, first,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0010.wav|to make the administration of all federal justice speedier and, therefore, less costly;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0011.wav|secondly, to bring to the decision of social and economic problems younger men who have had personal experience and contact|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0012.wav|with modern facts and circumstances under which average men have to live and work.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0013.wav|This plan will save our national Constitution from hardening of the judicial arteries.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0014.wav|The number of judges to be appointed would depend wholly on the decision of present judges now over seventy,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0015.wav|or those who would subsequently reach the age of seventy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0016.wav|If, for instance, any one of the six justices of the Supreme Court now over the age of seventy should retire as provided under the plan,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0017.wav|no additional place would be created.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0018.wav|Consequently, although there never can be more than fifteen, there may be only fourteen, or thirteen, or twelve.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0019.wav|And there may be only nine.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0020.wav|There is nothing novel or radical about this idea.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0021.wav|It seeks to maintain the federal bench in full vigor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0022.wav|It has been discussed and approved by many persons of high authority|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0023.wav|ever since a similar proposal passed the House of Representatives in 1869.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0024.wav|Why was the age fixed at seventy?|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0025.wav|Because the laws of many states, the practice of the Civil Service, the regulations of the Army and Navy,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0026.wav|and the rules of many of our universities and of almost every great private business enterprise,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0027.wav|commonly fix the retirement age at seventy years or less.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0028.wav|The statute would apply to all the courts in the federal system.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0029.wav|There is general approval so far as the lower federal courts are concerned.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0030.wav|The plan has met opposition only so far as the Supreme Court of the United States itself is concerned.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0031.wav|If such a plan is good for the lower courts it certainly ought to be equally good for the highest court from which there is no appeal.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0032.wav|"Those opposing this plan have sought to arouse prejudice and fear by crying that I am seeking to ""pack"" the Supreme Court"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0033.wav|and that a baneful precedent will be established.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0034.wav|"What do they mean by the words ""packing the Court""?"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0035.wav|Let me answer this question with a bluntness that will end all honest misunderstanding of my purposes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0036.wav|"If by that phrase ""packing the Court"" it is charged that I wish to place on the bench spineless puppets"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0037.wav|who would disregard the law and would decide specific cases as I wished them to be decided, I make this answer:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0038.wav|that no President fit for his office would appoint,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0039.wav|and no Senate of honorable men fit for their office would confirm, that kind of appointees to the Supreme Court.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0040.wav|But if by that phrase the charge is made|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0041.wav|that I would appoint and the Senate would confirm justices worthy to sit beside present members of the Court|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0042.wav|who understand those modern conditions,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0043.wav|that I will appoint justices who will not undertake to override the judgment of the Congress on legislative policy,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0044.wav|that I will appoint justices who will act as justices and not as legislators|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0045.wav|"if the appointment of such justices can be called ""packing the Courts,"""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0046.wav|then I say that I and with me the vast majority of the American people favor doing just that thing -- now.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0047.wav|Is it a dangerous precedent for the Congress to change the number of the justices? The Congress has always had, and will have, that power.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0048.wav|The number of justices has been changed several times before,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0049.wav|in the administration of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson -- both signers of the Declaration of Independence|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0050.wav|Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0051.wav|I suggest only the addition of justices to the bench|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0052.wav|in accordance with a clearly defined principle relating to a clearly defined age limit.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0053.wav|Fundamentally, if in the future, America cannot trust the Congress it elects to refrain from abuse of our Constitutional usages|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0054.wav|democracy will have failed far beyond the importance to it of any king of precedent concerning the judiciary.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0055.wav|We think it so much in the public interest to maintain a vigorous judiciary|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0056.wav|that we encourage the retirement of elderly judges by offering them a life pension at full salary.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0057.wav|Why then should we leave the fulfillment of this public policy to chance|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0058.wav|or make independent on upon the desire or prejudice of any individual justice?|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0059.wav|It is the clear intention of our public policy to provide for a constant flow of new and younger blood into the judiciary.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0060.wav|Normally every President appoints a large number of district and circuit court judges and a few members of the Supreme Court.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0061.wav|Until my first term practically every President of the United States has appointed at least one member of the Supreme Court.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0062.wav|President Taft appointed five members and named a Chief Justice;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0063.wav|President Wilson, three; President Harding, four, including a Chief Justice; President Coolidge, one;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0064.wav|President Hoover, three, including a Chief Justice.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0065.wav|Such a succession of appointments should have provided a Court well-balanced as to age.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0066.wav|But chance and the disinclination of individuals to leave the Supreme bench|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0067.wav|have now given us a Court in which five justices will be over seventy-five years of age before next June|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0068.wav|and one over seventy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0069.wav|Thus a sound public policy has been defeated.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0070.wav|I now propose that we establish by law an assurance against any such ill-balanced court in the future.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0071.wav|I propose that hereafter, when a judge reaches the age of seventy,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0072.wav|a new and younger judge shall be added to the court automatically.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0073.wav|In this way I propose to enforce a sound public policy by law|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0074.wav|instead of leaving the composition of our federal courts, including the highest,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0075.wav|to be determined by chance or the personal indecision of individuals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0076.wav|If such a law as I propose is regarded as establishing a new precedent,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0077.wav|is it not a most desirable precedent?|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0078.wav|Like all lawyers, like all Americans, I regret the necessity of this controversy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0079.wav|But the welfare of the United States, and indeed of the Constitution itself, is what we all must think about first.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0080.wav|Our difficulty with the Court today rises not from the Court as an institution but from human beings within it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0081.wav|But we cannot yield our constitutional destiny to the personal judgment of a few men who, being fearful of the future,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0082.wav|would deny us the necessary means of dealing with the present.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0083.wav|This plan of mine is no attack on the Court;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0084.wav|it seeks to restore the Court to its rightful and historic place in our constitutional government|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0085.wav|"and to have it resume its high task of building anew on the Constitution ""a system of living law."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0086.wav|The Court itself can best undo what the Court has done.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0087.wav|I have thus explained to you the reasons that lie behind our efforts to secure results by legislation within the Constitution.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0088.wav|I hope that thereby the difficult process of constitutional amendment may be rendered unnecessary. But,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0089.wav|let us examine the process.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0090.wav|There are many types of amendment proposed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0091.wav|Each one is radically different from the other.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0092.wav|There is no substantial groups within the Congress or outside it who are agreed on any single amendment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0093.wav|It would take months or years to get substantial agreement upon the type and language of the amendment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0094.wav|It would take months and years thereafter to get a two-thirds majority in favor of that amendment in both Houses of the Congress.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0095.wav|Then would come the long course of ratification by three-fourths of all the states.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0096.wav|No amendment which any powerful economic interests or the leaders of any powerful political party have had reason to oppose|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0097.wav|has ever been ratified within anything like a reasonable time.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0098.wav|And thirteen states which contain only five percent of the voting population can block ratification|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0099.wav|even though the thirty- five states with ninety-five percent of the population are in favor of it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0100.wav|A very large percentage of newspaper publishers, Chambers of Commerce,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0101.wav|Bar Association, Manufacturers' Associations, who are trying to give the impression that they really do want a constitutional amendment|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0102.wav|would be the first to exclaim as soon as an amendment was proposed|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0103.wav|Oh! I was for an amendment all right, but this amendment you proposed is not the kind of amendment that I was thinking about.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0104.wav|I am therefore, going to spend my time, my efforts and my money|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0105.wav|to block the amendment, although I would be awfully glad to help get some other kind of amendment ratified.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0106.wav|Two groups oppose my plan on the ground that they favor a constitutional amendment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0107.wav|The first includes those who fundamentally object to social and economic legislation along modern lines.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0108.wav|This is the same group who during the campaign last Fall tried to block the mandate of the people.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0109.wav|Now they are making a last stand.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0110.wav|And the strategy of that last stand is to suggest the time-consuming process of amendment in order to kill off by delay|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0111.wav|the legislation demanded by the mandate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0112.wav|To them I say: I do not think you will be able long to fool the American people as to your purposes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0113.wav|The other groups is composed of those who honestly believe the amendment process is the best|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0114.wav|and who would be willing to support a reasonable amendment if they could agree on one.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0115.wav|To them I say: we cannot rely on an amendment as the immediate or only answer to our present difficulties.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0116.wav|When the time comes for action,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0117.wav|you will find that many of those who pretend to support you will sabotage any constructive amendment which is proposed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0118.wav|Look at these strange bed-fellows of yours.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0119.wav|When before have you found them really at your side in your fights for progress?|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0120.wav|And remember one thing more.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0121.wav|Even if an amendment were passed, and even if in the years to come it were to be ratified,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0122.wav|its meaning would depend upon the kind of justices who would be sitting on the Supreme Court bench.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0123.wav|An amendment, like the rest of the Constitution,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0124.wav|is what the justices say it is rather than what its framers or you might hope it is.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0125.wav|This proposal of mine will not infringe in the slightest upon the civil or religious liberties so dear to every American.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0126.wav|My record as Governor and President proves my devotion to those liberties.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0127.wav|You who know me can have no fear that I would tolerate the destruction by any branch of government of any part of our heritage of freedom.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0128.wav|The present attempt by those opposed to progress to play upon the fears of danger to personal liberty|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0129.wav|brings again to mind that crude and cruel strategy tried by the same opposition|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0130.wav|to frighten the workers of America in a pay-envelope propaganda against the Social Security Law.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0131.wav|The workers were not fooled by that propaganda then. The people of America will not be fooled by such propaganda now.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0132.wav|I am in favor of action through legislation:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0133.wav|First, because I believe that it can be passed at this session of the Congress.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0134.wav|Second, because it will provide a reinvigorated|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0135.wav|liberal-minded judiciary necessary to furnish quicker and cheaper justice from bottom to top.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0136.wav|Third, because it will provide a series of federal courts willing to enforce the Constitution as written,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0137.wav|and unwilling to assert legislative powers by writing into it their own political and economic policies.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0138.wav|During the past half century the balance of power between the three great branches of the federal government,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0139.wav|has been tipped out of balance by the courts in direct contradiction of the high purposes of the framers of the Constitution.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0140.wav|It is my purpose to restore that balance.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0006.wav|that the functions or workings of the organs of plants, animals or man are quite distinct,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0007.wav|so much so as to require discussion in different treatises.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0008.wav|This is true only as a matter of detail,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0009.wav|for in the past fifty years it has been made evident that in general principles all living things are fundamentally similar.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0010.wav|One of the most important summaries of this similarity|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0011.wav|"is Huxley's famous essay, ""The Border Territory Between the Animal and Vegetable Kingdoms,"" written in 1876,"|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0013.wav|"In the second edition of the ""Regne Animal,"" published in 1828,"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0014.wav|Cuvier devotes a special section to the Division of Organized Beings into Animals and Vegetables,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0015.wav|in which the question is treated with that comprehensiveness of knowledge and clear critical judgment which characterize his writings|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0016.wav|and justify biologists in regarding them as representative expressions of the most extensive, if not the profoundest, knowledge of his time.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0017.wav|He affirms that living beings have been subdivided from the earliest times into animated beings, which possess sense and motion,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0018.wav|and inanimated beings, which are devoid of these functions and simply vegetable.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0019.wav|Although the roots of plants direct themselves toward moisture and their leaves toward air and light,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0020.wav|although the parts of some plants exhibit oscillating movements without any perceptible cause and the leaves of others retract when touched,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0021.wav|yet none of these movements justify the ascription to plants of perception of will.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0022.wav|From the mobility of animals Cuvier, with his characteristic partiality for teleological reasoning,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0023.wav|reduces the necessity of the existence in them of an alimentary cavity, or reservoir of food,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0024.wav|whence their nutrition may be drawn by vessels, which are a sort of internal roots; and, in the presence of this alimentary cavity|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0025.wav|he naturally sees the primary and the most important distinction between animals and plants,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0026.wav|Following out his teleological argument, Cuvier remarks that the organization of this cavity|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0027.wav|and its appurtenances must needs vary according to the nature of the aliment and the operations which it has to undergo|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0028.wav|before it can be converted into substances fitted for absorption,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0029.wav|while the atmosphere and the earth supply plants with juices ready prepared and which can be absorbed immediately.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0030.wav|As the animal body required to be independent of heat and of the atmosphere,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0031.wav|there were no means by which the motion of its fluids could be produced by internal causes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0032.wav|Hence arose the second great distinctive character of animals, or the circulatory system, which is less important than the digestive,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0033.wav|since it was unnecessary, and therefore is absent, in the more simple animals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0034.wav|Animals further needed muscles for locomotion and nerves for sensibility.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0035.wav|Hence, says Cuvier, it was necessary that the chemical composition of the animal body should be more complicated than that of the plant;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0036.wav|and it is so, inasmuch as an additional substance -- nitrogen -- enters into it as an essential element;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0037.wav|while in plants nitrogen is only accidentally joined with the three other fundamental constituents of organic beings|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0038.wav|carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0039.wav|he afterward affirms that nitrogen is peculiar to animals, and herein he places the third distinction between the animal and the plant.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0040.wav|The soil and the atmosphere supply plants with water composed of hydrogen and oxygen|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0041.wav|and carbonic acid containing carbon and oxygen.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0042.wav|They retain the hydrogen and the carbon, exhale the superfluous oxygen and absorb little or no nitrogen.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0043.wav|The essential character of vegetable life is the exhalation of oxygen, which is effected through the agency of light.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0044.wav|Animals, on the contrary, derive their nourishment either directly or indirectly from plants.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0045.wav|They get rid of the superfluous hydrogen and carbon and accumulate nitrogen.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0046.wav|The relations of plants and animals to the atmosphere are therefore inverse.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0047.wav|The plant withdraws water and carbonic acid from the atmosphere, the animal contributes both to it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0048.wav|Respiration -- that is, the absorption of oxygen and the exhalation of carbonic acid|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0049.wav|is the specially animal function of animals and constitutes their fourth distinctive character.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0050.wav|Thus wrote Cuvier in 1828.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0051.wav|But in the fourth and fifth decades of this century|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0052.wav|the greatest and most rapid revolution which biological science has ever undergone was effected by the application of the modern microscope|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0053.wav|to the investigation of organic structure,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0054.wav|by the introduction of exact and easily manageable methods of conducting the chemical analysis of organic compounds and finally|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0055.wav|by the employment of instruments of precision for the measurement of the physical forces which are at work in the living economy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0056.wav|That the semi-fluid contents (which we now term protoplasm) of the cells of certain plants,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0057.wav|such as the Charae, are in constant and regular motion was made out by Bonaventura Corti a century ago;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0058.wav|but the fact, important as it was, fell into oblivion and had to be rediscovered by Treviranus in 1807.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0059.wav|Robert Brown noted the more complex motions of the protoplasm in the cells of Tradescantia in 1831,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0060.wav|and now such movements of the living substance of plants are well known to be some of the most widely prevalent phenomena of vegetable life.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0061.wav|Agardh and other of the botanists of Cuvier's generation who occupied themselves with the lower plants had observed that,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0062.wav|under particular circumstances, the contents of the cells of certain water-weeds were set free and moved about with considerable velocity|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0063.wav|and with all the appearances of spontaneity as locomotive bodies,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0064.wav|"which, from their similarity to animals of simple organization, were called ""zoospores."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0065.wav|Even as late as 1845, however, a botanist of Schleiden's eminence dealt very skeptically with these statements,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0066.wav|and his skepticism was the more justified since Ehrenberg in his elaborate and comprehensive work on the infusoria,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0067.wav|had declared the greater number of what are now recognized as locomotive plants to be animals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0068.wav|At the present day, writes Huxley,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0069.wav|innumerable plants and free plant cells are known to pass the whole or part of their lives in an actively locomotive condition,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0070.wav|in nowise distinguishable from that of one of the simpler animals, and|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0071.wav|while in this condition their movements are, to all appearances, as spontaneous -- as much the product of volition -- as those of such animals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0072.wav|Hence the teleological argument for Cuvier's first diagnostic character|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0073.wav|the presence in animals of an alimentary cavity, or internal pocket, in which they can carry about their nutriment|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0074.wav|has broken down, so far, at least, as his mode of stating it goes. And|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0075.wav|with the advance of microscopic anatomy, the universality of the fact itself among animals has ceased to be predicable.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0076.wav|Many animals of even complex structure which live parasitically within others are wholly devoid of an alimentary cavity.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0077.wav|Their food is provided for them,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0078.wav|not only ready cooked but ready digested, and the alimentary canal, become superfluous, has disappeared, and, again,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0079.wav|the males of most Rotifers have no digestive apparatus.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0080.wav|Finally amid the lowest forms of animal life the speck of gelatinous protoplasm, which constitutes the whole body,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0081.wav|has no permanent digestive cavity or mouth, but takes in its food anywhere and digests, so to speak, all over its body.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0082.wav|But although Cuvier's leading diagnosis of the animal from the plant will not stand a strict test,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0083.wav|it remains one of the most constant of the distinctive characters of animals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0084.wav|And if we substitute for the possession of an alimentary cavity the power of taking solid nutriment into the body and there digesting it,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0085.wav|the definition so changed will cover all animals, except certain parasites,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0086.wav|and the few and exceptional cases of non-parasitic animals which do not feed at all.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0087.wav|On the other hand, the definition thus amended will exclude all ordinary vegetable organisms.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0088.wav|Cuvier himself practically gives up his second distinctive mark when he admits that it is wanting in the simpler animals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0089.wav|The third distinction is based on a completely erroneous conception of the chemical differences|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0090.wav|and resemblances between the constituents of animal and vegetable organisms, for which Cuvier is not responsible,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0091.wav|as it was current among contemporary chemists.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0092.wav|It is now established that nitrogen is as essential a constituent of vegetable as of animal living matter|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0093.wav|and that the latter is, chemically speaking, just as complicated as the former.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0094.wav|Starchy substances, cellulose and sugar,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0095.wav|once supposed to be exclusively confined to plants, are now known to be regular and normal products of animals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0096.wav|Amylaceous and saccharine substances are largely manufactured, even by the highest animals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0097.wav|Cellulose is widespread as a constituent of the skeletons of the lower animals|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0098.wav|and it is probable that amyloid substances are universally present in the animal organism, though not in the precise form of starch.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0099.wav|Moreover, although it remains true that there is an inverse relation between the green plant in sunshine and the animal,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0100.wav|in so far as under these circumstances the green plant|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0101.wav|decomposes carbonic acid and exhales oxygen while the animal absorbs oxygen and exhales carbonic acid,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0102.wav|yet the exact researches of the modern chemical investigators of the physiological processes of plants have clearly demonstrated the fallacy|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0103.wav|of attempting to draw any general distinction between animals and vegetables on this ground. In fact, the difference vanishes with the sunshine,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0104.wav|even in the case of the green plant, which in the dark absorbs oxygen and gives out carbonic acid like any animal.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0105.wav|On the other hand, those plants, such as the fungi,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0106.wav|which contain no chlorophyll and are not green, are always, so far as respiration is concerned, in the exact position of animals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0107.wav|They absorb oxygen and give out carbonic acid.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0108.wav|Thus, by the progress of knowledge, Cuvier's fourth distinction between the animal and the plant|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0109.wav|has been as completely invalidated as the third and second, and even the first can be retained only in a modified form|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0110.wav|and subject to exceptions.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0111.wav|But has the advance of biology simply tended to break down old distinctions without establishing new ones?|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0112.wav|With a qualification, to be considered presently, the answer to this question is undoubtedly in the affirmative.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0113.wav|The famous researches of Schwann and Schleiden in 1837 and the following years|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0114.wav|founded the modern science of histology or that branch of anatomy which deals with the ultimate visible structure of organisms as revealed by the microscope,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0115.wav|and from that day to this the rapid improvement of methods of investigation and the energy of a host of accurate observers|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0116.wav|have given greater and greater breadth and firmness to Schwann's great generalization|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0117.wav|that a fundamental unity of structure obtains in animals and plants,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0118.wav|and that, however diverse may be the fabrics or tissues of which their bodies are composed, all these varied structures result|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0119.wav|"from the metamorphosis of morphological units (termed cells in a more general sense than that in which the word ""cells"" was at first employed),"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0120.wav|which are not only similar in animals and in plants respectively,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0121.wav|but present a close resemblance when those of animals and those of plants are compared together.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0146.wav|And the question whether plants are provided with a nervous system or not thus acquires a new aspect and presents the histologist and physiologist|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0147.wav|with a problem of extreme difficulty, which must be attacked from a new point of view and by the aid of methods which have yet to be invented.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0148.wav|"Thus it must be admitted, he says again, ""that plants may be contractile and locomotive;"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0149.wav|that, while locomotive, their movements may have as much appearance of spontaneity as those of the lowest animals,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0154.wav|and which certainly hold good for the vast majority of animals and plants, are of universal application.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0155.wav|A bean may be supplied with water in which salts of ammonia and certain other mineral salts are dissolved in due proportion,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0168.wav|Whence it follows that the bean has taken in only the raw materials of its fabric and has manufactured them into bean-stuffs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0169.wav|The bean has been able to perform this great chemical feat by the help of its green coloring matter, or chlorophyll,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0008.wav|and the beginner in biological study is surprised to find them described in textbooks of both botany and zoology.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0009.wav|The fact is that they are on the border line, are neither plants nor animals but simply organisms.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0010.wav|Since they cannot be classified, it is necessary that they be listed both under botany and zoology, in order to make sure that they will not be omitted entirely.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0011.wav|Because of these uncertain forms of life,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0012.wav|Haeckel proposed once to include all one-celled animals and plants in a third kingdom to be called Protista (meaning the first of all life).|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0013.wav|Parker's definition of animals and plants,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0014.wav|based on the foregoing considerations, is convenient for distinguishing between animals and plants in all cases except the doubtful unicellar forms.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0015.wav|He says: Animals are organisms of fixed and definite form, in which the cell-body is not covered with a cellulose wall.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0019.wav|they cannot ingest solid food, but are nourished by a watery solution of nutrient materials.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0020.wav|If chlorophyll is present, the carbon dioxide of the air serves as a source of carbon,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0021.wav|nitrogen is obtained from simple salts and the nutritive processes result in deoxidation;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0022.wav|if chlorophyll is absent, carbon is obtained from sugar or some similar compound,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0044.wav|In order to emphasize the fundamental similarity of organic function in higher and lower animals and plants, let us compare any higher plant|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0046.wav|In each the life is the sum total of a series of definite processes -- nutrition or food supply,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0049.wav|In turn these will be compared for the animal and the plant,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0050.wav|following in part the comparisons of certain animals and plants by Sedgwick and Wilson and others.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0051.wav|These comparisons will, however, be translated into terms applicable to any species of higher plants or animals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0052.wav|In the nutrition of the animal the most essential and characteristic part of the food supply is derived from vegetable|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0053.wav|or animal matter in the form of various organic compounds, of which the most important are proteids (protoplasm, albumen, etc.),|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0054.wav|carbohydrates (starch, cellulose) and fats.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0055.wav|These materials are used by the animal in the manufacture of new protoplasm to take the place of that which has been used up.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0056.wav|It is, however, impossible for the animal to build these materials directly into the substance of its own body.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0057.wav|They must first undergo certain preparatory chemical changes known collectively as digestion|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0058.wav|and only after the completion of this process can all the food be absorbed into the circulation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0059.wav|For this purpose the food is taken not into the body proper, but into a kind of tubular chemical laboratory; called the alimentary canal,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0060.wav|through which it slowly passes, being subjected meanwhile to the action of certain chemical substances or reagents, known as digestive ferments.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0061.wav|These substances, which are dissolved in a watery liquid to form the digestive fluid, are secreted by the walls of the alimentary tube.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0062.wav|Through their action the solid portions are liquefied and the food is rendered capable of absorption into the body proper.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0063.wav|The food supply of the higher plant, like that of the animal, is the source of the required matter and energy,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0064.wav|but unlike that of the animal, it is not chiefly an income of foods, but only of the raw materials of food.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0065.wav|Matter enters the plant in the liquid or gaseous form by diffusion,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0066.wav|both from the soil through the roots (liquids) and from the atmosphere through the leaves (gases).|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0067.wav|We have here the direct absorption into the body proper of food-stuffs precisely as the animal takes in water and oxygen.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0068.wav|Energy enters the plant, to a small extent,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0069.wav|as the potential energy of foodstuffs, but comes in principally as the kinetic energy of sunlight absorbed in the leaves.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0070.wav|Of the substances the solids (salts, etc.) must be dissolved in water before they can be taken in.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0071.wav|Water and dissolved salts continually pass by diffusion from the soil into the roots, where together they constitute the sap.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0072.wav|The sap travels throughout the whole plant, the main though not the only cause of movement|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0073.wav|being the constant transpiration (evaporation) of watery vapor from the leaves, especially through the stomata.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0074.wav|The gaseous matters (carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen) enter the plant mainly by diffusion from the atmosphere,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0075.wav|are dissolved by the sap in the leaves and elsewhere and thus may pass to every portion of the plant.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0076.wav|The green plant owes its power of absorbing the energy of sunlight|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0077.wav|to the chlorophyll bodies or chromatophores, for plants which, like fungi, etc., are devoid of chlorophyll, are unable thus to acquire energy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0078.wav|Entering the chlorophyll bodies, the kinetic energy of sunlight is applied to the decomposition of carbon dioxide and water.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0079.wav|After passing through manifold but imperfectly known processes, the elements of these substances finally reappear as starch,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0080.wav|often in the form of granules embedded in the chlorophyll bodies and free oxygen, most of which is returned to the atmosphere.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0081.wav|Thus the leaf of a green plant in the light is continually absorbing carbon dioxide and giving forth free oxygen.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0082.wav|Carbon dioxide and water contain no potential energy, since the affinities of their constituent elements are completely satisfied.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0083.wav|Starch, however, contains potential energy, since the molecule is relatively unstable|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0084.wav|i.e., capable of decomposition into simpler, stabler molecules in which stronger affinities are satisfied.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0085.wav|And this is due to the fact that in the manufacture of starch in the chlorophyll bodies|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0086.wav|the kinetic energy of sunlight was expended in lifting the atoms into position of vantage, thus endowing them with energy of position.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0087.wav|In this way some of the radiant and kinetic energy of the sun comes to be stored up as potential energy in the starch.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0088.wav|In short, the green plant is able by cooperation with sunlight to use simple raw materials (carbon dioxide, water, oxygen, etc.)|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0089.wav|poor in energy or devoid of it, and out of them to manufacture food -- i.e. complex compounds rich in available potential energy.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0090.wav|This power is possessed by green plants alone; all other organisms being dependent for energy upon the potential energy of ready-made food.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0091.wav|This must, in the first instance, be provided for them by green plants, and hence without chlorophyll-bearing plants,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0092.wav|animals (and colorless plants as well) apparently could not long exist.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0093.wav|The plant absorbs also a small amount of kinetic energy, independently of the sunlight, in the form of heat.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0094.wav|This, however, is probably not a source of vital energy, but only contributes to the maintenance of the body temperature.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0095.wav|Food (starch) thus produced in the green leaves of higher plants and the inorganic foods|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0105.wav|This is done by diastase, an enzyme of plant cells.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0106.wav|The change is from starch to a sugar capable of diffusion.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0107.wav|Dissolved in water, the sugar is transported down delicate tubes, chiefly in the growing bark region of the stem.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0120.wav|The building up of the protoplasm from proteids is anabolism, constructive metabolism.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0121.wav|The destruction of protoplasm, excess proteids or the fat and carbohydrate foods is catabolism, destructive metabolism.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0124.wav|In the plant, starch, as has been seen, is first formed in the chlorophyll-bodies.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0125.wav|But the formation of starch, all important as it is, is after all only the manufacture of food|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0127.wav|These processes must take place everywhere in ordinary protoplasm,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0128.wav|for it is here that oxidation occurs and the need for a renewal of matter and energy consequently arises.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0129.wav|Sooner or later the starch grains are changed into a kind of sugar (glucose), which, unlike starch, dissolves in the sap|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0131.wav|Wherever there is need for new protoplasm, whether to repair previous waste or to supply materials for growth,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0132.wav|after absorption into the cells the elements of the starch (or glucose) are, by the living protoplasm, in some unknown way|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0133.wav|combined with nitrogen and sulphur (probably also with salts, water, etc.) to form proteid matter.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0136.wav|it may be reconverted into starch after journeying as glucose through the plant|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0137.wav|"and be laid down as ""reserve starch"" in the cells of root or stem or elsewhere."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0138.wav|Apparently when this reserve supply is finally needed at any point in the plant, it is again changed to glucose and transported thither.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0139.wav|It is probable that new leaves and new tissues generally are always formed in part from this reserve starch.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0140.wav|In the plant as in the animal metabolism must consist of anabolic and catabolic processes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0141.wav|The construction in the cells of new proteid from the absorbed carbohydrate and the materials from the soil is true anabolism.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0142.wav|It is also clear that catabolism or oxidation for the liberation of energy occurs as in animals, but this process is slower.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0143.wav|Probably foods containing carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are the sources of energy in the higher plants as in animals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0144.wav|In both plants and animals simple waste substances result from the catabolic processes in the cells.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0145.wav|In the animal carbon dioxide, water and nitrogen compounds are the chief excretions.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0146.wav|They are absorbed by the circulating liquids and carried to the eliminating organs, lungs and kidneys chiefly, for elimination.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0147.wav|In the higher plants the excretions are carbon dioxide, which escapes through the epidermis of root, stem and leaf and through the stomata;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0152.wav|Oxygenation is the term used to denote the oxygen-supplying part of respiration;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0154.wav|In the animal oxygen is absorbed by the blood, in excess by the hemoglobin of the red cells of the blood|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0156.wav|In the plant also oxygen is absorbed through the epidermis and stomata from the air.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0157.wav|This process is, however, obscured during the day because of the oxygen freed in the manufacture of starch which goes on at that time.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0158.wav|Probably this freed oxygen is used for the purpose of oxygenation, but more is freed in the photosynthetic process than is needed for oxygenation|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0159.wav|and hence the excess oxygen is eliminated while starch manufacture is in process.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0160.wav|In comparing a higher animal and a green plant confusion must be avoided regarding the part played by oxygen and carbon dioxide in true respiration|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0008.wav|The great variety of life as exhibited in the countless species of plants and animals has been referred to, and yet, great as this variety is,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0009.wav|there are, after all, only a few types of structure among all animals and plants, some three or four or eight or ten general modes of development,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0010.wav|and all the rest are modifications from these few types.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0011.wav|It is, moreover, true that all living forms are but series of modifications and extensions of one single plan of structure.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0012.wav|All have the same ultimate substance|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0013.wav|the mysterious semi-fluid network of protoplasm, which is, so far as is known, the physical basis of all life;|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0015.wav|which in some fashion presides over all the movements of the protoplasm and is the physical basis of the phenomena of heredity.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0016.wav|The same laws of heredity, variability and of response to outside stimulus hold in all parts of the organic world.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0019.wav|And at last each organism or each alliance of organisms must come to the greatest concession of all, which is called death.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0021.wav|Whatever emphasis is laid upon the diversity of life, the essential unity of all organisms must not be forgotten.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0022.wav|An examination of the facts in each of the lines of evidence makes it clear|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0024.wav|is the theory of descent -- i.e., that similarities are due to blood relationship and that differences come from adaptive modifications.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0025.wav|The facts adduced from morphology, being the result of researches into the structure of adult animals and plants,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0026.wav|lead to a preview of certain principles of adaptation, necessary for their interpretation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0027.wav|First, it must be noted that some structures are not non-adaptive, that is, do not change to fit changed habits or conditions of life.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0028.wav|Such structures or organs are most often found internally.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0029.wav|For illustration: a change in the locomotive habit of a bird from that of flying to that of an ostrich|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0030.wav|is associated with an adaptive modification of locomotor structures, legs and wings,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0031.wav|but not in any striking way is there change in the internal organs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0032.wav|Internal organs may persist unchanged and hence they offer good guides to classification.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0033.wav|On the other hand, external structures are likely to undergo adaptation when habits or conditions of life change.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0034.wav|"Hence, as Jordan has said, ""the inside of an animal tells the real history of its ancestry; the outside tells us only where its ancestors have been."""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0035.wav|In the second place, it must be noted that adaptations to similar conditions may result in superficial resemblances.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0036.wav|For example, there is a superficial resemblance between the wing of an insect and the wing of a bird|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0039.wav|both adaptations for pumping blood;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0040.wav|between the fin of a fish and the paddle of a whale|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0041.wav|both adaptive swimming organs, yet the resemblance in these cases does not go deeper than the surface -- it is one of function only.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0042.wav|"All such cases of resemblance in function but not in detailed plan of structure are called ""analogies,"""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0043.wav|and mean nothing more than similarity of environment.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0044.wav|Turning to more fundamental resemblances, such as the wing of a bat and the wing of a bird,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0045.wav|"careful study shows detailed internal as well as external similarities of structure. Such cases are ""homologies""."|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0112.wav|How, then, are they to be accounted for?|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0113.wav|Of course the theory of descent with adaptive modification has a simple answer to supply|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0114.wav|Namely that when from changed conditions of life, an organ which was previously useful becomes useless,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0115.wav|it will be suffered to dwindle away in successive generations, under the influence of certain natural causes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0116.wav|On the other hand, the theory of special creation can only maintain that these rudiments are formed for the sake of adhering to an ideal type.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0117.wav|Now, here again the former theory appears to be triumphant over the latter, says Romanes,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0119.wav|surely if such a method were adopted in so many cases, we should expect that in consistency it would be adopted in all cases.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0120.wav|This reasonable expectation, however, is far from being realized.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0121.wav|In numberless cases, such as that of the fore-limbs of serpents, no vestige of a rudiment is present.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0122.wav|But the vacillating policy in the matter of rudiments does not end here; for it is shown in a still more aggravated form|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0123.wav|where within the limits of the same natural group of organisms a rudiment is sometimes present and sometimes absent.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0124.wav|For instance, although in nearly all the numerous species of snakes there are no vestiges of limbs,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0125.wav|in the Python we find very tiny rudiments of the hindlimbs. Now,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0126.wav|is it a worthy conception of Deity that,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0127.wav|while neglecting to maintain his unity of ideal in the case of nearly all the numerous species of snakes, he should have added a tiny rudiment in the case of the Python|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0133.wav|to present the mass of embryological evidence, but a few salient facts will illustrate the kind of evidence to be deduced from embryology.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0134.wav|"Most remarkable of all the principles which have been discovered by embryologists is the ""Recapitulation Doctrine"""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0135.wav|which, briefly stated, is that individual development (ontogeny) recapitulates ancestral history (phylogeny).|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0136.wav|Illustrations quoted from the works of Romanes and Le Conte will make this principle clear.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0137.wav|It is an observable fact, says Romanes,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0138.wav|that there is often a close correspondence between developmental changes as revealed by any chronological series of fossils which may happen to have been preserved,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0139.wav|and developmental changes which may be observed during the life history of now existing individuals belonging to the same group of animals.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0141.wav|is closely reproduced in the life-history of existing deer. Or, in other words,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0142.wav|"the antlers of an existing deer furnish in their development a kind of ""resume,"" or recapitulation, of the successive phases"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0143.wav|whereby the primitive horn was gradually superseded by horns presenting a greater and greater number of prongs in successive species of extinct deer.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0144.wav|Now, it must be obvious|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0145.wav|that such a recapitulation in the life history of an existing animal of developmental changes successively distinctive of sundry allied,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0146.wav|though now extinct species, speaks strongly in favor of evolution.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0147.wav|For as it is of the essence of this theory that new forms arise from older forms by way of hereditary descent,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0148.wav|we should antecedently expect, if the theory is true,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0149.wav|that the phases of development presented by the individual organism would follow, in their main outlines, those phases of development|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0150.wav|through which their long line of ancestors had passed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0151.wav|The only alternative view is that as species of deer,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0152.wav|for instance, were separately created, additional prongs were successively added to their antlers; and yet that,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0153.wav|in order to be so added to successive species, every individual deer belonging to later species was required to repeat in his own lifetime|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0154.wav|the process of successive additions which had previously taken place in a remote series of extinct species.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0155.wav|Now I do not deny that this view is a possible view; but I do deny that it is a probable one.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0156.wav|According to the evolutionary interpretation of such facts, we can see a very good reason why the life-history of the individual|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0157.wav|is thus a condensed resume of the life history of its ancestral species.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0158.wav|But according to the opposite view no reason can be assigned why such should be the case.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0159.wav|It is well known, likewise comments Le Conte,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0160.wav|that the embryo or larva of a frog or toad, when first hatched, is a legless, tail-swimming, water-breathing, gill-breathing animal.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0161.wav|It is essentially a fish, and would be so classed if it remained in this condition.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0162.wav|The fish retains permanently this form, but the frog passes on.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0163.wav|Next, it forms first one pair and then another pair of legs; and meanwhile it begins to breathe also by lungs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0164.wav|At this stage it breathes equally by lungs and by gills -- i.e., both air and water.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0165.wav|Now, the lower forms of amphibians, such as siredon, menobranchus, siren, etc.,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0166.wav|"retain permanently this form, and are therefore called ""perennibranchs,"" but the frog still passes on."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0167.wav|Then the gills gradually dry up, as the lungs develop, and they now breathe wholly by lungs, but still retain the tail.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0168.wav|Now this is the permanent, mature condition of many amphibians,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0169.wav|"such as the triton, the salamander, etc., which are therefore called ""caducibranchs,"" but the frog still passes on."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0170.wav|Finally, it loses the tail, or rather its tail is absorbed and its material used in further development, and it becomes a perfect frog,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0171.wav|the highest order (anoura) of this class. Thus, then, in ontogeny the fish goes no further than the fish stages.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0172.wav|The perennibranch passes through the fish stage to the perennibranch amphibian.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0173.wav|The caducibranch takes first the fish form, then the perennibranch form, and finally the caducibranch form, but goes no further.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0174.wav|Last, the anoura takes first the fish-form, then that of the perennibranch, then that of the caducibranch, and finally becomes anoura.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0175.wav|Now, this is undoubtedly the order of succession of forms in geological times -- i.e., in the phylogenic series.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0176.wav|Fishes first appeared in the Devonian and Upper Silurian in very reptilian or rather amphibian forms.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0177.wav|Then in the Carboniferous, fishes still continuing, there appeared the lowest -- i.e., most fish-like forms of amphibians.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0178.wav|These were undoubtedly perennibranchs. In the Permian and Triassic higher forms appeared, which were certainly caducibranch.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0179.wav|Finally, only in the Tertiary, so far as we yet know, do the highest form (anoura) appear.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0013.wav|During 1963, the reasons for making the trip became more persuasive.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0014.wav|As a political leader, the President wished to resolve the factional controversy within the Democratic Party in Texas before the election of 1964.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0015.wav|The party itself saw an opportunity to raise funds by having the President speak at a political dinner eventually planned for Austin.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0016.wav|As Chief of State, the President always welcomed the opportunity to learn, firsthand, about the problems which concerned the American people.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0042.wav|As advance agent working closely with Sorrels, Lawson had responsibility for arranging the timetable for the President's visit to Dallas|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0071.wav|An important purpose of the President's visit to Dallas was to speak at a luncheon given by business and civic leaders.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0072.wav|The White House staff informed the Secret Service|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0073.wav|that the President would arrive and depart from Dallas' Love Field; that a motorcade through the downtown area of Dallas to the luncheon site should be arranged;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0074.wav|and that following the luncheon the President would return to the airport by the most direct route.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0075.wav|Accordingly, it was important to determine the luncheon site as quickly as possible, so that security could be established at the site and the motorcade route selected.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0076.wav|On November 4, Gerald A. Behn, agent in charge of the White House detail, asked Sorrels to examine three potential sites for the luncheon.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0077.wav|One building, Market Hall, was unavailable for November 22.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0078.wav|The second, the Women's Building at the State Fair Grounds,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0079.wav|was a one-story building with few entrances and easy to make secure, but it lacked necessary food-handling facilities|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0080.wav|and had certain unattractive features, including a low ceiling with exposed conduits and beams.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0081.wav|The third possibility, the Trade Mart, a handsome new building with all the necessary facilities, presented security problems. It had numerous entrances,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0082.wav|several tiers of balconies surrounding the central court where the luncheon would be held, and several catwalks crossing the court at each level.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0083.wav|On November 4, Sorrels told Behn he believed security difficulties at the Trade Mart could be overcome by special precautions.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0084.wav|Lawson also evaluated the security hazards at the Trade Mart on November 13.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0085.wav|Kenneth O'Donnell made the final decision to hold the luncheon at the Trade Mart; Behn so notified Lawson on November 14.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0086.wav|Once the Trade Mart had been selected, Sorrels and Lawson worked out detailed arrangements for security at the building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0087.wav|In addition to the preventive measures already mentioned, they provided for controlling access to the building, closing off and policing areas around it,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0088.wav|securing the roof and insuring the presence of numerous police officers inside and around the building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0089.wav|Ultimately more than 200 law enforcement officers, mainly Dallas police but including 8 Secret Service agents,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0090.wav|were deployed in and around the Trade Mart.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0092.wav|On November 8, when Lawson was briefed on the itinerary for the trip to Dallas,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0093.wav|he was told that 45 minutes had been allotted for a motorcade procession from Love Field to the luncheon site.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0094.wav|Lawson was not specifically instructed to select the parade route, but he understood that this was one of his functions.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0095.wav|Even before the Trade Mart had been definitely selected, Lawson and Sorrels began to consider the best motorcade route from Love Field to the Trade Mart.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0096.wav|On November 14, Lawson and Sorrels attended a meeting at Love Field|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0097.wav|and on their return to Dallas drove over the route which Sorrels believed best suited for the proposed motorcade.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0098.wav|This route, eventually selected for the motorcade from the airport to the Trade Mart, measured 10 miles and could be driven easily within the allotted 45 minutes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0099.wav|From Love Field the route passed through a portion of suburban Dallas,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0100.wav|through the downtown area along Main Street and then to the Trade Mart via Stemmons Freeway.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0101.wav|For the President's return to Love Field following the luncheon, the agents selected the most direct route, which was approximately 4 miles.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0102.wav|After the selection of the Trade Mart as the luncheon site,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0103.wav|Lawson and Sorrels met with Dallas Chief of Police Jesse E. Curry, Assistant Chief Charles Batchelor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0104.wav|Deputy Chief N. T. Fisher, and several other command officers to discuss details of the motorcade and possible routes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0105.wav|The route was further reviewed by Lawson and Sorrels with Assistant Chief Batchelor and members of the local host committee on November 15.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0106.wav|The police officials agreed that the route recommended by Sorrels was the proper one and did not express a belief that any other route might be better.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0107.wav|On November 18,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0108.wav|Sorrels and Lawson drove over the selected route with Batchelor and other police officers, verifying that it could be traversed within 45 minutes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0109.wav|Representatives of the local host committee and the White House staff were advised by the Secret Service of the actual route on the afternoon of November 18.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0110.wav|The route impressed the agents as a natural and desirable one.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0111.wav|Sorrels, who had participated in Presidential protection assignments in Dallas since a visit by President Franklin D. Roosevelt|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0112.wav|in 1936, as testified that the traditional parade route in Dallas was along Main Street, since the tall buildings along the street|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0113.wav|gave more people an opportunity to participate.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0114.wav|The route chosen from the airport to Main Street was the normal one, except where Harwood Street was selected as the means of access to Main Street|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0115.wav|in preference to a short stretch of the Central Expressway, which presented a minor safety hazard|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0116.wav|and could not accommodate spectators as conveniently as Harwood Street.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0117.wav|According to Lawson, the chosen route seemed to be the best.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0118.wav|It afforded us wide streets most of the way, because of the buses that were in the motorcade.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0119.wav|It afforded us a chance to have alternative routes if something happened on the motorcade route. It was the type of suburban area a good part of the way|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0120.wav|where the crowds would be able to be controlled for a great distance, and we figured that the largest crowds would be downtown, which they were,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0121.wav|and that the wide streets that we would use downtown would be of sufficient width to keep the public out of our way.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0122.wav|Elm Street, parallel to Main Street and one block north,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0123.wav|was not used for the main portion of the downtown part of the motorcade because Main Street offered better vantage points for spectators.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0124.wav|To reach the Trade Mart from Main Street the agents decided to use the Stemmons Freeway (Route No. 77), the most direct route.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0125.wav|The only practical way for westbound traffic on Main Street|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0126.wav|to reach the northbound lanes of the Stemmons Freeway is via Elm Street, which Route No. 77 traffic is instructed to follow in this part of the city.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0127.wav|Elm Street was to be reached from Main by turning right at Houston,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0128.wav|going one block north and then turning left onto Elm.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0129.wav|On this last portion of the journey, only 5 minutes from the Trade Mart,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0130.wav|the President's motorcade would pass the Texas School Book Depository Building on the northwest corner of Houston and Elm Streets.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0131.wav|The building overlooks Dealey Plaza, an attractively landscaped triangle of 3 acres.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0136.wav|through the underpass and leads into an access road,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0137.wav|which branches off to the right and is used by traffic going to the Stemmons Freeway and the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0138.wav|The Elm Street approach to the Stemmons Freeway is necessary|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0139.wav|in order to avoid the traffic hazards which would otherwise exist if right turns were permitted from both Main and Elm into the freeway.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0140.wav|To create this traffic pattern, a concrete barrier between Main and Elm Streets presents an obstacle to a right turn|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0146.wav|The planning for the motorcade also included advance preparations for security arrangements along the route.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ029-0147.wav|Sorrels and Lawson reviewed the route in cooperation with Assistant Chief Bachelor and other Dallas police officials who took notes on the requirements|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0124.wav|by Sebastian F. Latona, supervisor of the Latent Fingerprint Section of the FBI's Identification Division.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0125.wav|In his testimony before the Commission, Latona stated that when he received the rifle, the area where prints were visible was protected by cellophane.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0126.wav|He examined these prints, as well as photographs of them which the Dallas police had made, and concluded that:|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0127.wav|the formations, the ridge formations and characteristics, were insufficient for purposes of either effecting identification|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0128.wav|or a determination that the print was not identical with the prints of people.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0129.wav|Accordingly, my opinion simply was that the latent prints which were there were of no value, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0130.wav|Latona then processed the complete weapon but developed no identifiable prints.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0131.wav|He stated that the poor quality of the wood and the metal would cause the rifle to absorb moisture from the skin, thereby making a clear print unlikely.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0132.wav|On November 22, however, before surrendering possession of the rifle to the FBI Laboratory,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0133.wav|"Lieutenant Day of the Dallas Police Department had ""lifted"" a palmprint from the underside of the gun barrel"|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0134.wav|quote, near the firing end of the barrel about 3 inches under the woodstock when I took the woodstock loose, end quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0135.wav|Lifting a print involves the use of adhesive material to remove the fingerprint powder which adheres to the original print.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0136.wav|In this way the powdered impression is actually removed from the object.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0137.wav|The lifting had been so complete in this case that there was no trace of the print on the rifle itself when it was examined by Latona.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0138.wav|Nor was there any indication that the lift had been performed.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0139.wav|Day, on the other hand, believed that sufficient traces of the print had been left on the rifle barrel,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0140.wav|"because he did not release the lifted print until November 26, when he received instructions to send ""everything that we had"" to the FBI."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0141.wav|The print arrived in the FBI Laboratory in Washington on November 29, mounted on a card on which Lieutenant Day had written the words|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0142.wav|quote, off underside gun barrel near end of grip C2766, end quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0143.wav|The print's positive identity as having been lifted from the rifle|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0144.wav|was confirmed by FBI Laboratory tests which established that the adhesive material bearing the print|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0145.wav|also bore impressions of the same irregularities that appeared on the barrel of the rifle.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0146.wav|Latona testified that this palmprint was the right palmprint of Lee Harvey Oswald.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0147.wav|At the request of the Commission, Arthur Mandella,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0148.wav|fingerprint expert with the New York City Police Department, conducted an independent examination and also determined that this was the right palmprint of Oswald.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0149.wav|Latona's findings were also confirmed by Ronald G. Wittmus, another FBI fingerprint expert.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0150.wav|In the opinion of these experts, it was not possible to estimate the time which elapsed between the placing of the print on the rifle and the date of the lift.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0151.wav|Experts testifying before the Commission agreed that palmprints are as unique as fingerprints for purposes of establishing identification.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0152.wav|Oswald's palmprint on the underside of the barrel demonstrates that he handled the rifle when it was disassembled.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0153.wav|A palmprint could not be placed on this portion of the rifle, when assembled, because the wooden foregrip covers the barrel at this point.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0154.wav|The print is additional proof that the rifle was in Oswald's possession.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0155.wav|Fibers on Rifle|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0156.wav|In a crevice between the butt plate of the rifle and the wooden stock|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0157.wav|was a tuft of several cotton fibers of dark blue, gray-black, and orange-yellow shades.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0158.wav|On November 23, 1963,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0159.wav|these fibers were examined by Paul M. Stombaugh, a special agent assigned to the Hair and Fiber Unit of the FBI Laboratory.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0160.wav|He compared them with the fibers found in the shirt which Oswald was wearing when arrested in the Texas Theatre.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0161.wav|This shirt was also composed of dark blue, gray- black and orange-yellow cotton fibers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0162.wav|Stombaugh testified that the colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft on the rifle matched those in Oswald's shirt.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0163.wav|Stombaugh explained in his testimony that in fiber analysis, as distinct from fingerprint or firearms identification,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0164.wav|it is not possible to state with scientific certainty that a particular small group of fibers come from a certain piece of clothing|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0165.wav|to the exclusion of all others because there are not enough microscopic characteristics present in fibers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0166.wav|Judgments as to probability will depend on the number and types of matches.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0167.wav|He concluded, quote, There is no doubt in my mind that these fibers could have come from this shirt.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0168.wav|There is no way, however, to eliminate the possibility of the fibers having come from another identical shirt, end quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0169.wav|Having considered the probabilities as explained in Stombaugh's testimony,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0170.wav|the Commission has concluded that the fibers in the tuft on the rifle most probably came from the shirt worn by Oswald when he was arrested,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0171.wav|and that this was the same shirt which Oswald wore on the morning of the assassination.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0172.wav|Marina Oswald testified that she thought her husband wore this shirt to work on that day.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0173.wav|The testimony of those who saw him after the assassination was inconclusive about the color of Oswald's shirt,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0174.wav|but Mary Bledsoe, a former landlady of Oswald, saw him on a bus approximately 10 minutes after the assassination|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0175.wav|and identified the shirt as being the one worn by Oswald primarily because of a distinctive hole in the shirt's right elbow.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0176.wav|Moreover, the bus transfer which he obtained as he left the bus was still in the pocket when he was arrested.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0177.wav|Although Oswald returned to his roominghouse after the assassination and when questioned by the police, claimed to have changed his shirt,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0178.wav|the evidence indicates that he continued wearing the same shirt which he was wearing all morning and which he was still wearing when arrested.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0179.wav|In light of these findings the Commission evaluated the additional testimony of Stombaugh|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0180.wav|that the fibers were caught in the crevice of the rifle's butt plate, quote, in the recent past, end quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0181.wav|Although Stombaugh was unable to estimate the period of time the fibers were on the rifle he said that the fibers, quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0182.wav|were clean, they had good color to them, there was no grease on them and they were not fragmented. They looked as if they had just been picked up, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0183.wav|The relative freshness of the fibers is strong evidence that they were caught on the rifle on the morning of the assassination or during the preceding evening.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0184.wav|For 10 days prior to the eve of the assassination Oswald had not been present at Ruth Paine's house in Irving, Texas, where the rifle was kept.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0185.wav|Moreover, the Commission found no reliable evidence that Oswald used the rifle at any time between September 23,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0186.wav|when it was transported from New Orleans, and November 22, the day of the assassination.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0187.wav|The fact that on the morning of the assassination Oswald was wearing the shirt from which these relatively fresh fibers most probably originated,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0188.wav|provides some evidence that they were placed on the rifle that day|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0189.wav|since there was limited, if any, opportunity for Oswald to handle the weapon during the 2 months prior to November 22.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0190.wav|On the other hand Stombaugh pointed out that fibers might retain their freshness if the rifle had been|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0191.wav|quote, put aside, end quote, after catching the fibers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0192.wav|The rifle used in the assassination probably had been wrapped in a blanket for about 8 weeks prior to November 22.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0193.wav|Because the relative freshness of these fibers might be explained by the continuous storage of the rifle in the blanket,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0194.wav|the Commission was unable to reach any firm conclusion as to when the fibers were caught in the rifle.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0195.wav|The Commission was able to conclude, however, that the fibers most probably came from Oswald's shirt.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0196.wav|This adds to the conviction of the Commission that Oswald owned and handled the weapon used in the assassination.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0199.wav|the Oswalds lived on Neely Street in Dallas in a rented house which had a small back yard.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0200.wav|One Sunday, while his wife was hanging diapers, Oswald asked her to take a picture of him holding a rifle, a pistol|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0201.wav|and issues of two newspapers later identified as the Worker and the Militant.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0202.wav|Two pictures were taken. The Commission has concluded that the rifle shown in these pictures is the same rifle which was found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0203.wav|on November 22, 1963. One of these pictures, Exhibit No. 133-A, shows most of the rifle's configuration.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0204.wav|Special Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, a photography expert with the FBI,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0205.wav|photographed the rifle used in the assassination, attempting to duplicate the position of the rifle and the lighting in Exhibit No. 133-A.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0206.wav|After comparing the rifle in the simulated photograph with the rifle in Exhibit No. 133-A, Shaneyfelt testified, quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0207.wav|I found it to be the same general configuration. All appearances were the same, end quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0208.wav|He found, quote, one notch in the stock at this point that appears very faintly in the photograph, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0209.wav|He stated, however, that while he, quote, found no differences, end quote, between the rifles in the two photographs, he could not make a, quote, positive identification|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0210.wav|to the exclusion of all other rifles of the same general configuration, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0211.wav|The authenticity of these pictures has been established by expert testimony which links the second picture,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0212.wav|Commission Exhibit No. 133-B, to Oswald's Imperial Reflex camera, with which Marina Oswald testified she took the pictures.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0213.wav|The negative of that picture, Commission Exhibit No. 133-B, was found among Oswald's possessions.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0214.wav|Using a recognized technique of determining whether a picture was taken with a particular camera,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0215.wav|Shaneyfelt compared this negative with a negative which he made by taking a new picture with Oswald's camera.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0216.wav|He concluded that the negative of Exhibit No. 133-B was exposed in Oswald's Imperial Reflex camera to the exclusion of all other cameras.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0217.wav|He could not test Exhibit No. 133-A in the same way because the negative was never recovered.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0218.wav|Both pictures, however, have identical backgrounds and lighting and, judging from the shadows, were taken at the same angle.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0219.wav|They are photographs of the same scene.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0220.wav|Since Exhibit No. 133-B was taken with Oswald's camera,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0221.wav|it is reasonably certain that Exhibit No. 133-A was taken by the same camera at the same time, as Marina Oswald testified.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0222.wav|Moreover, Shaneyfelt testified that in his opinion the photographs were not composites of two different photographs|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0223.wav|and that Oswald's face had not been superimposed on another body.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0224.wav|One of the photographs taken by Marina Oswald was widely published in newspapers and magazines,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0225.wav|and in many instances the details of these pictures differed from the original, and even from each other, particularly as to the configuration of the rifle.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0226.wav|The Commission sought to determine whether these photographs were touched prior to publication.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0227.wav|Shaneyfelt testified that the published photographs appeared to be based on a copy of the original which the publications had each retouched differently.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0228.wav|Several of the publications furnished the Commission with the prints they had used, or described by correspondence the retouching they had done.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0229.wav|This information enabled the Commission to conclude|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0230.wav|that the published pictures were the same as the original except for retouching done by these publications, apparently for the purpose of clarifying the lines of the rifle|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0231.wav|and other details in the picture.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0232.wav|The dates surrounding the taking of this picture and the purchase of the rifle|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0233.wav|reinforce the belief that the rifle in the photograph is the rifle which Oswald bought from Klein's.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0234.wav|The rifle was shipped from Klein's in Chicago on March 20, 1963, at a time when the Oswalds were living on Neely Street.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0235.wav|From an examination of one of the photographs, the Commission determined the dates of the issues of the Militant and the Worker which Oswald was holding in his hand.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0236.wav|By checking the actual mailing dates of these issues and the time it usually takes to effect delivery to Dallas,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0237.wav|it was established that the photographs must have been taken sometime after March 27.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0238.wav|Marina Oswald testified that the photographs were taken on a Sunday about 2 weeks before the attempted shooting of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0260.wav|He thought it contained tent poles, or possibly other camping equipment such as a folding shovel.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0268.wav|This bulge was apparently caused by a hard protruding object which had stretched the blanket's fibers.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0038.wav|the Commission gave weight to the fact that Oswald gave a false reason for returning home on November 21,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0039.wav|and one which provided an excuse for the carrying of a bulky package the following morning.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0052.wav|The period between 8 and 9 p.m., however, provided ample opportunity for Oswald to prepare the rifle for his departure the next morning.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0111.wav|that the bag which Oswald was carrying was approximately 27 or 28 inches long, whereas the wooden stock of the rifle, which is its largest component,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0112.wav|measured 34.8 inches.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0113.wav|The bag found on the sixth floor was 88 inches long.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0116.wav|Frazier placed the upper part of the package under his armpit and attempted to cup his right hand beneath the bottom of the bag.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0117.wav|The disassembled rifle was too long to be carried in this manner.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0118.wav|Similarly, when the butt of the rifle was placed in Frazier's hand, it extended above his shoulder to ear level.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0119.wav|Moreover, in an interview on December 1, 1963, with agents of the FBI, Frazier had marked the point on the back seat of his car|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0120.wav|which he believed was where the bag reached when it was laid on the seat with one edge against the door.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0121.wav|The distance between the point on the seat and the door was 27 inches.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0122.wav|Mrs. Randle said, when shown the paper bag,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0123.wav|that the bag she saw Oswald carrying, quote, wasn't that long, I mean it was folded down at the top as I told you. It definitely wasn't that long, end quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0124.wav|And she folded the bag to length of about 28 and a half inches.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0125.wav|Frazier doubted whether the bag that Oswald carried was as wide as the bag found on the sixth floor, although Mrs. Randle testified|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0126.wav|that the width was approximately the same.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0127.wav|The Commission has weighed the visual recollection of Frazier and Mrs. Randle against the evidence here presented|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0128.wav|that the bag Oswald carried contained the assassination weapon and has concluded that Frazier and Randle are mistaken as to the length of the bag.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0129.wav|Mrs. Randle saw the bag fleetingly|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0130.wav|and her first remembrance is that it was held in Oswald's right hand, quote, and it almost touched the ground as he carried it, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0131.wav|Frazier's view of the bag was from the rear. He continually advised that he was not paying close attention. For example, he said, quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0132.wav|I didn't pay too much attention the way he was walking because I was walking along there looking at the railroad cars and watching the men on the diesel switch them cars|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0133.wav|and I didn't pay too much attention on how he carried the package at all, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0134.wav|Frazier could easily have been mistaken when he stated that Oswald held the bottom of the bag cupped in his hand with the upper end tucked into his armpit.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0137.wav|It was not a standard type bag which could be obtained in a store and it was presumably made for a particular purpose.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0140.wav|Three cartons had been placed at the window apparently to act as a gun rest and a fourth carton was placed behind those at the window.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0141.wav|A person seated on the fourth carton could assemble the rifle without being seen from the rest of the sixth floor|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0142.wav|because the cartons stacked around the southeast corner would shield him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0143.wav|The presence of the bag in this corner is cogent evidence that it was used as the container for the rifle.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0152.wav|The portion of the palm which was identified was the heel of the right palm, i.e., the area near the wrist, on the little finger side.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0153.wav|These prints were examined independently by Ronald G. Wittmus of the FBI,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0155.wav|Both concluded that the prints were the right palm and left index finger of Lee Oswald. No other identifiable prints were found on the bag.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0156.wav|Oswald's palmprint on the bottom of the paper bag indicated, of course, that he had handled the bag.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0157.wav|Furthermore, it was consistent with the bag having contained a heavy or bulky object when he handled it since a light object is usually held by the fingers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0158.wav|The palmprint was found on the closed end of the bag.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0159.wav|It was from Oswald's right hand, in which he carried the long package as he walked from Frazier's car to the building.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0161.wav|On the day of the assassination, the Dallas police obtained a sample of wrapping paper and tape|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0162.wav|from the shipping room of the Depository and forwarded it to the FBI Laboratory in Washington.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0163.wav|James C. Cadigan, a questioned-documents expert with the Bureau, compared the samples with the paper and tape in the actual bag.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0164.wav|He testified, quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0165.wav|In all of the observations and physical tests that I made I found the bag and the paper sample were the same, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0166.wav|Among other tests, the paper and tape were submitted to fiber analysis and spectrographic examination.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0167.wav|In addition the tape was compared to determine whether the sample tape and the tape on the bag had been taken from the tape dispensing machine at the Depository.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0168.wav|When asked to explain the similarity of characteristics, Cadigan stated, quote, well briefly|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0169.wav|it would be the thickness of both the paper and the tape, the color under various lighting conditions of both the paper and the tape,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0170.wav|the width of the tape, the knurled markings on the surface of the fiber, the texture of the fiber, the letting pattern|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0171.wav|I found that the paper sack found on the sixth floor and the sample|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0172.wav|had the same observable characteristics both under the microscope and all the visual tests that I could conduct.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0173.wav|The papers I also found were similar in fiber composition, therefore, in addition to the visual characteristics,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0175.wav|Mr. Cadigan concluded that the paper and tape from the bag were identical in all respects to the sample paper and tape|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0176.wav|taken from the Texas School Book Depository shipping room on November 22, 1963.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0177.wav|On December 1, 1963, a replica bag was made from materials found on that date in the shipping room.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0178.wav|This was done as an investigatory aid|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0179.wav|since the original bag had been discolored during various laboratory examinations and could not be used for valid identification by witnesses.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0180.wav|Cadigan found that the paper used to make this replica sack had different characteristics from the paper in the original bag.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0181.wav|The science of paper analysis enabled him to distinguish between different rolls of paper even though they were produced by the same manufacturer.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0182.wav|Since the Depository normally used approximately one roll of paper every 3 working days,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0183.wav|it was not surprising that the replica sack made on December 1, 1963,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0184.wav|had different characteristics from both the actual bag and the sample taken on November 22.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0185.wav|On the other hand, since two rolls could be made from the same batch of paper,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0186.wav|one cannot estimate when, prior to November 22, Oswald made the paper bag.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0187.wav|However, the complete identity of characteristics between the paper and tape in the bag found on the sixth floor|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0188.wav|and the paper and tape found in the shipping room of the Depository on November 22|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0189.wav|enabled the Commission to conclude that the bag was made from these materials.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0194.wav|The blanket in which the rifle was stored was composed of brown and green cotton, viscose and woolen fibers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0195.wav|The single brown viscose fiber found in the bag matched some of the brown viscose fibers from the blanket in all observable characteristics.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0196.wav|The green cotton fibers found in the paper bag matched some of the green cotton fibers in the blanket|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0198.wav|Despite these matches, however, Stombaugh was unable to render on opinion that the fibers which he found in the bag had probably come from the blanket,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0199.wav|because other types of fibers present in the blanket were not found in the bag.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0200.wav|He concluded, quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0201.wav|All I would say here is that it is possible that these fibers could have come from this blanket.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0202.wav|because this blanket is composed of brown and green woolen fibers, brown and green delustered viscose fibers, and brown and green cotton fibers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0203.wav|We found no brown cotton fibers, no green viscose fibers, and no woolen fibers.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0204.wav|So if I found all of these then I would have been able to say these fibers probably had come from this blanket. But since I found so few,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0205.wav|then I would say the possibility exists, these fibers could have come from this blanket, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0206.wav|Stombaugh confirmed that the rifle could have picked up fibers from the blanket and transferred them to the paper bag.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ033-0207.wav|In light of the other evidence linking Lee Harvey Oswald, the blanket, and the rifle to the paper bag found on the sixth floor,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0033.wav|During the afternoon of November 22,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0034.wav|Lieutenant Day of the Dallas police dusted this carton with powder and developed a palmprint on the top edge of the carton on the side nearest the window.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0035.wav|The position of this palmprint on the carton was parallel with the long axis of the box, and at right angles with the short axis;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0036.wav|the bottom of the palm rested on the box.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0037.wav|Someone sitting on the box facing the window would have his palm in this position if he placed his hand alongside his right hip.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0038.wav|This print which had been cut out of the box was also forwarded to the FBI and Latona identified it as Oswald's right palmprint.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0039.wav|In Latona's opinion, quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0040.wav|not too long, end quote, a time had elapsed between the time that the print was placed on the carton and the time that it had been developed by the Dallas police.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0041.wav|Although Bureau experiments had shown that 24 hours was a likely maximum time, Latona stated|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0042.wav|that he could only testify with certainty that the print was less than 3 days old.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0043.wav|The print, therefore, could have been placed on the carton at any time within this period.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0044.wav|The freshness of this print could be estimated only because the Dallas police developed it through the use of powder.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0045.wav|Since cartons absorb perspiration, powder can successfully develop a print on such material only within a limited time.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0046.wav|When the FBI in Washington received the cartons, the remaining prints, including Oswald's on the Rolling Readers carton,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0047.wav|were developed by chemical processes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0048.wav|The freshness of prints developed in this manner cannot be estimated,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0049.wav|so no conclusions can be drawn as to whether these remaining prints preceded or followed the print developed in Dallas by powder.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0050.wav|Most of the prints were found to have been placed on the cartons by an FBI clerk|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0051.wav|and a Dallas police officer after the cartons had been processed with powder by the Dallas Police.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0052.wav|In his independent investigation, Arthur Mandella of the New York City Police Department|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0053.wav|reached the same conclusion as Latona that the prints found on the cartons were those of Lee Harvey Oswald.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0054.wav|In addition, Mandella was of the opinion that the print taken from the carton on the floor|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0055.wav|was probably made within a day or a day and a half of the examination on November 22.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0056.wav|Another expert with the FBI, Ronald G. Wittmus, conducted a separate examination and also agreed with Latona that the prints were Oswald's.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0057.wav|In evaluating the significance of these fingerprint and palmprint identifications,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0058.wav|the Commission considered the possibility that Oswald handled these cartons as part of his normal duties.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0059.wav|Since other identifiable prints were developed on the cartons, the Commission requested that they be compared with the prints of the 12 warehouse employees|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0060.wav|who, like Oswald, might have handled the cartons. They were also compared with the prints of those law enforcement officials who might have handled the cartons.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0061.wav|The results of this investigation are fully discussed in chapter 6, page 249.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0062.wav|Although a person could handle a carton and not leave identifiable prints,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0063.wav|none of these employees except Oswald left identifiable prints on the cartons.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0064.wav|This finding, in addition to the freshness of one of the prints and the presence of Oswald's prints on two of the four cartons and the paper bag|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0065.wav|led the Commission to attach some probative value to the fingerprint and palmprint identifications in reaching the conclusion|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0066.wav|that Oswald was at the window from which the shots were fired, although the prints do not establish the exact time he was there.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0069.wav|was provided by the testimony of Charles Givens, who was the last known employee to see Oswald inside the building prior to the assassination.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0070.wav|During the morning of November 22, Givens was working with the floor-laying crew in the southwest section of the sixth floor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0071.wav|At about 11:45 a.m. the floor-laying crew used both elevators to come down from the sixth floor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0072.wav|The employees raced the elevators to the first floor. Givens saw Oswald standing at the gate on the fifth floor as the elevator went by.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0073.wav|Givens testified that after reaching the first floor, quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0074.wav|I discovered I left my cigarettes in my jacket pocket upstairs, and I took the elevator back upstairs to get my jacket with my cigarettes in it, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0075.wav|He saw Oswald, a clipboard in hand, walking from the southeast corner of the sixth floor toward the elevator.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0076.wav|Givens said to Oswald, quote, Boy are you going downstairs? It's near lunch time, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0077.wav|Oswald said, quote, No, sir. When you get downstairs, close the gate to the elevator, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0078.wav|"Oswald was referring to the west elevator which operates by pushbutton and only with the gate closed. Givens said, ""Okay,"""|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0079.wav|and rode down in the east elevator.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0080.wav|When he reached the first floor, the west elevator -- the one with the gate was not there.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0081.wav|Givens thought this was about 11:55 a.m.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0082.wav|None of the Depository employees is known to have seen Oswald again until after the shooting.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0083.wav|The significance of Givens' observation that Oswald was carrying his clipboard|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0084.wav|became apparent on December 2, 1963, when an employee, Frankie Kaiser,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0085.wav|found a clipboard hidden by book cartons in the northwest corner of the sixth floor at the west wall a few feet from where the rifle had been found.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0086.wav|This clipboard had been made by Kaiser and had his name on it.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0087.wav|Kaiser identified it as the clipboard which Oswald had appropriated from him when Oswald came to work at the Depository.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0088.wav|Three invoices on this clipboard, each dated November 22, were for Scott-Foresman books, located on the first and sixth floors.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0091.wav|Howard L. Brennan was an eyewitness to the shooting. As indicated previously the Commission considered his testimony as probative|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0092.wav|in reaching the conclusion that the shots came from the sixth floor, southeast corner window of the Depository Building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0093.wav|Brennan also testified that Lee Harvey Oswald,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0094.wav|whom he viewed in a police lineup on the night of the assassination, was the man he saw fire the shots from the sixth-floor window of the Depository Building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0095.wav|When the shots were fired, Brennan was in an excellent position to observe anyone in the window. He was sitting on a concrete wall|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0096.wav|on the southwest corner of Elm and Houston Streets, looking north at the Depository Building which was directly in front of him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0097.wav|The window was approximately 120 feet away.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0098.wav|In the 6 to 8 minute period before the motorcade arrived, Brennan saw a man leave and return to the window, quote, a couple of times, end quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0099.wav|After hearing the first shot, which he thought was a motorcycle backfire, Brennan glanced up at the window. He testified that, quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0100.wav|this man I saw previously was aiming for his last shot. As it appeared to me he was standing up and resting against the left window sill, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0101.wav|Brennan saw the man fire the last shot and disappear from the window.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0102.wav|Within minutes of the assassination, Brennan described the man to the police.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0103.wav|This description most probably led to the radio alert sent to police cars at approximately 12:45 p.m., which described the suspect as white,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0104.wav|slender, weighing about one sixty-five pounds, about 5 foot 10 inches tall, and in his early thirties.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0106.wav|Brennan described the man in similar terms, except that he gave the weight as between 165 and 175 pounds and the height was omitted.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0107.wav|In his testimony before the Commission, Brennan described the person he saw as, quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0108.wav|man in his early thirties, fair complexion, slender, but neat, neat slender, possible 5 foot 10|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0109.wav|one-sixty to one-seventy pounds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0110.wav|Oswald was 5 foot 9 inches, slender and 24 years old.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0111.wav|When arrested, he gave his weight as 140 pounds. On other occasions he gave weights of both 140 and 150 pounds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0112.wav|The New Orleans police records of his arrest in August of 1963 show a weight of 136 pounds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0113.wav|The autopsy report indicated an estimated weight of 150 pounds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0114.wav|Brennan's description should also be compared with the eyewitness description broadcast over the Dallas police radio at 1:22 p.m.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0115.wav|of the man who shot Patrolman J. D. Tippit.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0116.wav|The suspect was described as, quote, a white male about 30, 5 foot 8, black hair, slender, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0117.wav|At 1:29 p.m. the police radio reported|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0118.wav|that the description of the suspect in the Tippit shooting was similar to the description which had been given by Brennan in connection with the assassination.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0119.wav|Approximately 7 or 8 minutes later|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0120.wav|the police radio reported that, quote, an eyeball witness, end quote, described the suspect in the Tippit shooting as, quote, a white male,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0121.wav|27, 5 foot 11, 165 pounds, black wavy hair, end quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0122.wav|As will be discussed fully below, the Commission has concluded that this suspect was Lee Harvey Oswald.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0123.wav|Although Brennan testified that the man in the window was standing when he fired the shots, most probably he was either sitting or kneeling.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0124.wav|The half-open window, the arrangement of the boxes, and the angle of the shots virtually preclude a standing position.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0125.wav|It is understandable, however, for Brennan to have believed that the man with the rifle was standing. A photograph of the building taken seconds after the assassination|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0126.wav|shows three employees looking out of the fifth-floor window directly below the window from which the shots were fired.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0127.wav|Brennan testified that they were standing, which is their apparent position in the photograph.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0128.wav|But the testimony of these employees, together with photographs subsequently taken of them at the scene of the assassination,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0129.wav|establishes that they were either squatting or kneeling.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0130.wav|Since the window ledges in the Depository Building are lower than in most buildings,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0131.wav|a person squatting or kneeling exposes more of his body than would normally be the case.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0132.wav|From the street, this creates the impression that the person is standing.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0133.wav|Brennan could have seen enough of the body of a kneeling or squatting person to estimate his height.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0134.wav|Shortly after the assassination Brennan noticed|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0135.wav|two of these employees leaving the building and immediately identified them as having been in the fifth-floor windows.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0136.wav|When the three employees appeared before the Commission, Brennan identified the two whom he saw leave the building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0137.wav|The two men, Harold Norman and James Jarman, Jr., each confirmed that when they came out of the building,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0138.wav|they saw and heard Brennan describing what he had seen.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0140.wav|Jarman heard Brennan, quote, talking to this officer about that he had heard these shots and he had seen the barrel of the gun sticking out the window,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0141.wav|and he said that the shots came from inside the building, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0142.wav|During the evening of November 22, Brennan identified Oswald as the person in the lineup who bore the closest resemblance to the man in the window|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0143.wav|but he said he was unable to make a positive identification.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0144.wav|Prior to the lineup,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0145.wav|Brennan had seen Oswald's picture on television, and he told the Commission that whether this affected his identification, quote, is something I do not know.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0146.wav|In an interview with FBI agents on December 17, 1963,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0147.wav|Brennan stated that he was sure that the person firing the rifle was Oswald.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0148.wav|In another interview with FBI agents on January 7, 1964,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0149.wav|Brennan appeared to revert to his earlier inability to make a positive identification,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0150.wav|but, in his testimony before the Commission, Brennan stated that his remarks of January 7 were intended by him merely as an accurate report|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0151.wav|of what he said on November 22.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0152.wav|Brennan told the Commission that he could have made a positive identification in the lineup on November 22|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0153.wav|but did not do so because he felt that the assassination was, quote, a Communist activity,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0154.wav|and I felt like there hadn't been more than one eyewitness, and if it got to be a known fact that I was an eyewitness, my family or I, either one, might not be safe.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0155.wav|When specifically asked before the Commission|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0156.wav|whether or not he could positively identify the man he saw in the sixth-floor window as the same man he saw in the police station,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0157.wav|Brennan stated, quote, I could at that time -- I could, with all sincerity, identify him as being the same man, end quote.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0159.wav|The Commission, therefore, does not base its conclusion concerning the identity of the assassin|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0162.wav|Brennan described to the police the man he saw in the window and then identified Oswald as the person who most nearly resembled the man he saw.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0173.wav|He said that the man held his attention until the motorcade came because the man, quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0174.wav|appeared uncomfortable for one, and secondly, he wasn't watching. he didn't look like he was watching for the parade.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0175.wav|He looked like he was looking down toward the Trinity River and the Triple Underpass down at the end -- toward the end of Elm Street. And|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0190.wav|Robert Edwards said that, while looking at the south side of the Depository Building shortly before the motorcade,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0191.wav|he saw nothing of importance, quote, except maybe one individual who was up there in the corner room of the sixth floor which was crowded in among boxes, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0192.wav|He said that this was a white man about average in size, quote, possibly thin, end quote, and that he thought the man had light-brown hair.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0193.wav|Fischer and Edwards did not see the man clearly enough or long enough to identify him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0194.wav|Their testimony is of probative value, however, because their limited description is consistent with that of the man who has been found by the Commission,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0195.wav|based on other evidence, to have fired the shots from the window.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0196.wav|Another person who saw the assassin as the shots were fired was Amos L. Euins, age 15,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0197.wav|who was one of the first witnesses to alert the police to the Depository as the source of the shots, as has been discussed in chapter 3.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0198.wav|Euins, who was on the southwest corner of Elm and Houston Streets testified that he could not describe the man he saw in the window.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0199.wav|According to Euins, however, as the man lowered his head in order to aim the rifle down Elm Street, he appeared to have a white bald spot, on his head.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0200.wav|"Shortly after the assassination, Euins signed an affidavit describing the man as ""white,"""|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0203.wav|Euins stated that he could not ascertain the man's race and that the statement in the affidavit was intended to refer only to the white spot on the man's head|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0204.wav|and not to his race.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0205.wav|A Secret Service agent who spoke to Euins approximately 20 to 30 minutes after the assassination|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0206.wav|confirmed that Euins could neither describe the man in the window nor indicate his race.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0207.wav|Accordingly, Euins' testimony is considered probative as to the source of the shots but is inconclusive as to the identity of the man in the window.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0208.wav|In evaluating the evidence that Oswald was at the southeast corner window of the sixth floor at the time of the shooting,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0209.wav|the Commission has considered the allegation that Oswald was photographed standing in front of the building when the shots were fired.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0210.wav|The picture which gave rise to these allegations was taken by Associated Press Photographer James W. Altgens,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0211.wav|who was standing on the south side of Elm Street between the Triple Underpass and the Depository Building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0212.wav|As the motorcade started its descent down Elm Street., Altgens snapped a picture of the Presidential limousine with the entrance to the Depository Building in the background.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0213.wav|Just before snapping the picture Altgens heard a noise which sounded like the popping of a firecracker.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0214.wav|Investigation has established that Altgens' picture was taken approximately 2 seconds after the firing of the shot|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0010.wav|As he turned the corner from Main onto Houston at a speed of about 5 to 10 miles per hour,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0011.wav|a strong wind blowing from the north almost unseated him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0012.wav|At about this time he heard the first shot.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0013.wav|Having recently heard the sounds of rifles while on a hunting trip, Baker recognized the shots as that of a high-powered rifle; Quote,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0015.wav|and I had a feeling that it came from the building, either right in front of me [the Depository Building] or of the one across to the right of it, end quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0016.wav|He saw pigeons flutter upward. He was not certain, quote, but I am pretty sure they came from the building right on the northwest corner, end quote.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0020.wav|As he was parking he noted that people were, quote, falling, and they were rolling around down there grabbing their children, end quote, and rushing about.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0022.wav|Baker, quote, had it in mind that the shots came from the top of this building here, end quote, so he ran straight to the entrance of the Depository Building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0023.wav|Baker testified that he entered the lobby of the building and, quote, spoke out and asked where the stairs or elevator was|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0024.wav|and this man, Mr. Truly, spoke up and says, it seems to me like he says,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0028.wav|to the northwest corner of the floor where Truly hoped to find one of the two freight elevators.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0029.wav|Neither elevator was there.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0030.wav|Truly pushed the button for the west elevator which operates automatically if the gate is closed.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0032.wav|When the elevator failed to come, Baker said, quote, let's take the stairs, end quote, and he followed Truly up the stairway, which is to the west of the elevator.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0033.wav|The stairway is located in the northwest corner of the Depository Building.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0035.wav|Because the stairway itself is enclosed, neither Baker nor Truly could see anything on the second-floor hallway until they reached the landing at the top of the stairs.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0036.wav|On the second-floor landing there is a small open area with a door at the east end.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0037.wav|This door leads into a small vestibule, and another door leads from the vestibule into the second-floor lunchroom.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0038.wav|The lunchroom door is usually open, but the first door is kept shut by a closing mechanism on the door.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0040.wav|As Baker reached the second floor, he was about 20 feet from the vestibule door. He intended to continue around to his left toward the stairway going up|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0041.wav|but through the window in the door he caught a fleeting glimpse of a man walking in the vestibule toward the lunchroom.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0042.wav|Since the vestibule door is only a few feet from the lunchroom door, the man must have entered the vestibule only a second or two before Baker arrived at the top of the stairwell.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0043.wav|Yet he must have entered the vestibule door before Truly reached the top of the stairwell, since Truly did not see him.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0054.wav|He had been proceeding toward the rear of the lunchroom.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0055.wav|Along a side wall of the lunchroom was a soft drink rending machine, but at that time the man had nothing in his hands.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0069.wav|Baker placed himself on a motorcycle about 200 feet from the corner of Elm and Houston Streets where he said he heard the shots.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0070.wav|Truly stood in front of the building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0071.wav|At a given signal, they reenacted the event. Baker's movements were timed with a stopwatch.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0072.wav|On the first test, the elapsed time between the simulated first shot and Baker's arrival on the second-floor stair landing|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0073.wav|was 1 minute and 30 seconds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0074.wav|The second test run required 1 minute and 15 seconds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0075.wav|A test was also conducted to determine the time required to walk from the southeast corner of the sixth floor to the second-floor lunchroom by stairway.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0076.wav|Special Agent John Howlett of the Secret Service carried a rifle from the southeast corner of the sixth floor along the east aisle to the northeast corner.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0077.wav|He placed the rifle on the floor near the site where Oswald's rifle was actually found after the shooting.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0078.wav|Then Howlett walked down the stairway to the second-floor landing and entered the lunchroom.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0079.wav|The first test, run at normal walking pace, required 1 minute, 18 seconds;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0080.wav|"the second test, at a ""fast walk"" took 1 minute, 14 seconds."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0081.wav|The second test followed immediately after the first.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0082.wav|The only interval was the time necessary to ride in the elevator from the second to the sixth floor and walk back to the southeast corner.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0083.wav|Howlett was not short winded at the end of either test run.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0084.wav|The minimum time required by Baker to park his motorcycle and reach the second-floor lunchroom was within 3 seconds of the time needed to walk|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0085.wav|from the southeast corner of the sixth floor down the stairway to the lunchroom.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0086.wav|The time actually required for Baker and Truly to reach the second floor on November 22 was probably longer than in the test runs. For example,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0087.wav|Baker required 15 seconds after the simulated shot to ride his motorcycle 180 to 200 feet,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0088.wav|park it, and run 45 feet to the building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0089.wav|No allowance was made for the special conditions which existed on the day of the assassination|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0090.wav|possible delayed reaction to the shot, jostling with the crowd of people on the steps and scanning the area along Elm Street and the parkway.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0091.wav|Baker said, quote, We simulated the shots and by the time we got there, we did everything that I did that day,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0092.wav|and this would be the minimum, because I am sure that I, you know, it took me a little longer, end quote,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0093.wav|On the basis of this time test, therefore,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0094.wav|the Commission concluded that Oswald could have fired the shots and still have been present in the second-floor lunchroom when seen by Baker and Truly.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0095.wav|That Oswald descended by stairway from the sixth floor to the second-floor lunchroom|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0096.wav|is consistent with the movements of the two elevators, which would have provided the other possible means of descent.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0097.wav|When Truly, accompanied by Baker, ran to the rear of the first floor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0098.wav|he was certain that both elevators, which occupy the same shaft, were on the fifth floor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0099.wav|Baker, not realizing that there were two elevators, thought that only one elevator was in the shaft and that it was two or three floors above the second floor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0100.wav|In the few seconds which elapsed while Baker and Truly ran from the first to the second floor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0101.wav|neither of these slow elevators could have descended from the fifth to the second floor. Furthermore, no elevator was at the second floor when they arrived there.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0102.wav|Truly and Baker continued up the stairs after the encounter with Oswald in the lunchroom.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0103.wav|There was no elevator on the third or fourth floor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0104.wav|The east elevator was on the fifth floor when they arrived; the west elevator was not.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0105.wav|They took the east elevator to the seventh floor and ran up a stairway to the roof where they searched for several minutes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0106.wav|Jack Dougherty, an employee working on the fifth floor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0107.wav|testified that he took the west elevator to the first floor after hearing a noise which sounded like a backfire.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0108.wav|Eddie Piper, the janitor, told Dougherty that the President had been shot,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0109.wav|but in his testimony Piper did not mention either seeing or talking with Dougherty during these moments of excitement.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0110.wav|Both Dougherty and Piper were confused witnesses. They had no exact memory of the events of that afternoon.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0111.wav|Truly was probably correct in stating that the west elevator was on the fifth floor when he looked up the elevator shaft from the first floor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0112.wav|The west elevator was not on the fifth floor when Baker and Truly reached that floor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0113.wav|probably because Jack Dougherty took it to the first floor while Baker and Truly were running up the stairs or in the lunchroom with Oswald.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0114.wav|Neither elevator could have been used by Oswald as a means of descent.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0115.wav|Oswald's use of the stairway is consistent with the testimony of other employees in the building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0116.wav|Three employees -- James Jarman, Jr.,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0117.wav|Harold Norman, and Bonnie Ray Williams -- were watching the parade from the fifth floor, directly below the window from which the shots were fired.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0118.wav|They rushed to the west windows after the shots were fired and remained there|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0119.wav|until after they saw Patrolman Baker's white helmet on the fifth floor moving toward the elevator.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0120.wav|While they were at the west windows their view of the stairwell was completely blocked by shelves and boxes.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0121.wav|This is the period during which Oswald would have descended the stairs. In all likelihood|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0122.wav|Dougherty took the elevator down from the fifth floor after Jarman, Norman, and Williams ran to the west windows and were deciding what to do.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0123.wav|None of these three men saw Dougherty, probably because of the anxiety of the moment and because of the books which may have blocked the view.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0124.wav|Neither Jarman, Norman, Williams, or Dougherty saw Oswald.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0125.wav|Victoria Adams, who worked on the fourth floor of the Depository Building,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0126.wav|claimed that within about 1 minute following the shots she ran from a window on the south side of the fourth floor,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0127.wav|down the rear stairs to the first floor, where she encountered two Depository employees -- William Shelley and Billy Lovelady.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0128.wav|If her estimate of time is correct, she reached the bottom of the stairs before Truly and Baker started up,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0129.wav|and she must have run down the stairs ahead of Oswald and would probably have seen or heard him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0130.wav|Actually she noticed no one on the back stairs. If she descended from the fourth to the first floor as fast as she claimed in her testimony,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0131.wav|she would have seen Baker or Truly on the first floor or on the stairs, unless they were already in the second-floor lunchroom talking to Oswald.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0132.wav|When she reached the first floor, she actually saw Shelley and Lovelady slightly east of the east elevator.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0133.wav|Shelley and Lovelady, however, have testified|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0134.wav|that they were watching the parade from the top step of the building entrance when Gloria Calverly, who works in the Depository Building,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0135.wav|ran up and said that the President had been shot.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0136.wav|Lovelady and Shelley moved out into the street.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0137.wav|About this time Shelley saw Truly and Patrolman Baker go into the building|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0138.wav|Shelley and Lovelady, at a fast walk or trot, turned west into the railroad yards and then to the west side of the Depository Building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0139.wav|They reentered the building by the rear door several minutes after Baker and Truly rushed through the front entrance.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0140.wav|On entering, Lovelady saw a girl on the first floor who he believes was Victoria Adams.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0141.wav|If Miss Adams accurately recalled meeting Shelley and Lovelady when she reached the bottom of the stairs,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0142.wav|then her estimate of the time when she descended from the fourth floor is incorrect,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0143.wav|and she actually came down the stairs several minutes after Oswald and after Truly and Baker as well.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0144.wav|Oswald's departure from building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0145.wav|Within a minute after Baker and Truly left Oswald in the lunchroom, Mrs. R. A. Reid, clerical supervisor for the Texas School Book Depository,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0146.wav|saw him walk through the clerical office on the second floor toward the door leading to the front stairway.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0147.wav|Mrs. Reid had watched the parade from the sidewalk in front of the building with Truly and Mr. O. V. Campbell, vice president of the Depository.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0148.wav|She testified that she heard three shots which she thought came from the building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0149.wav|She ran inside and up the front stairs into the large open office reserved for clerical employees.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0150.wav|As she approached her desk, she saw Oswald.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0151.wav|He was walking into the office from the back hallway,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0152.wav|carrying a full bottle of Coca-Cola in his hand, presumably purchased after the encounter with Baker and Truly.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0153.wav|As Oswald passed Mrs. Reid she said, quote, Oh, the President has been shot, but maybe they didn't hit him, end quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0154.wav|Oswald mumbled something and walked by. She paid no more attention to him.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0155.wav|The only exit from the office in the direction Oswald was moving was through the door to the front stairway.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0156.wav|Mrs. Reid testified that when she saw Oswald, he was wearing a T-shirt and no jacket.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0157.wav|When he left home that morning, Marina Oswald, who was still in bed, suggested that he wear a jacket.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0158.wav|A blue jacket, later identified by Marina Oswald as her husband's, was subsequently found in the building, apparently left behind by Oswald.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0159.wav|Mrs. Reid believes that she returned to her desk from the street about 2 minutes after the shooting.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0160.wav|Reconstructing her movements, Mrs. Reid ran the distance three times and was timed in 2 minutes by stopwatch.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0161.wav|The reconstruction was the minimum time. Accordingly, she probably met Oswald at about 12:32,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0162.wav|approximately 30 to 45 seconds after Oswald's lunchroom encounter with Baker and Truly.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0163.wav|After leaving Mrs. Reid in the front office, Oswald could have gone down the stairs and out the front door by 12:33 p.m.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0164.wav|3 minutes after the shooting.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0165.wav|At that time the building had not yet been sealed off by the police.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0166.wav|While it was difficult to determine exactly when the police sealed off the building,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0167.wav|the earliest estimates would still have permitted Oswald to leave the building by 12:33.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0168.wav|One of the police officers assigned to the corner of Elm and Houston Streets for the Presidential motorcade, W. E. Barnett,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0169.wav|testified that immediately after the shots he went to the rear of the building to check the fire escape.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0170.wav|He then returned to the corner of Elm and Houston where he met a sergeant who instructed him to find out the name of the building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0171.wav|Barnett ran to the building, noted its name, and then returned to the corner.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0172.wav|There he was met by a construction worker -- in all likelihood Howard Brennan, who was wearing his work helmet.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0173.wav|This worker told Barnett that the shots had been fired from a window in the Depository Building,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0174.wav|where upon Barnett posted himself at the front door to make certain that no one left the building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0175.wav|The sergeant did the same thing at the rear of the building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0176.wav|Barnett estimated that approximately 3 minutes elapsed between the time he heard the last of the shots and the time he started guarding the front door.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0177.wav|According to Barnett, quote, there were people going in and out, end quote, during this period.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0178.wav|Sgt. D. V. Harkness of the Dallas police|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0179.wav|said that to his knowledge the building was not sealed off at 12:36 p.m. when he called in on police radio|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0180.wav|that a witness (Amos Euins) had seen shots fired from a window of the building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0181.wav|At that time, Inspector Herbert V. Sawyer's car was parked in front of the building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0182.wav|Harkness did not know whether or not two officers with Sawyer were guarding the doors.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0183.wav|At 12:34 p.m. Sawyer heard a call over the police radio that the shots had come from the Depository Building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0184.wav|He then entered the building and took the front passenger elevator as far as it would go -- the fourth floor.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0185.wav|After inspecting this floor, Sawyer returned to the street about 3 minutes after he entered the building.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0186.wav|After he returned to the street he directed Sergeant Harkness to station two patrolmen at the front door and not let anyone in or out;|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0187.wav|he also directed that the back door be sealed off.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0188.wav|This was no earlier than 12:37 p.m. and may have been later.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0189.wav|Special Agent Forrest V. Sorrels of the Secret Service, who had been in the motorcade,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0190.wav|testified that after driving to Parkland Hospital, he returned to the Depository Building about 20 minutes after the shooting,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0191.wav|found no police officers at the rear door and was able to enter through this door without identifying himself.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0192.wav|Although Oswald probably left the building at about 12:33 p.m., his absence was not noticed until at least one-half hour later.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0193.wav|Truly, who had returned with Patrolman Baker from the roof, saw the police questioning the warehouse employees.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0194.wav|Approximately 15 men worked in the warehouse and Truly noticed that Oswald was not among those being questioned.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0195.wav|Satisfying himself that Oswald was missing, Truly obtained Oswald's address, phone number, and description from his employment application card.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0196.wav|The address listed was for the Paine home in Irving.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0197.wav|Truly gave this information to Captain Fritz who was on the sixth floor at the time.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0017.wav|He probably walked east on Elm Street for seven blocks to the corner of Elm and Murphy|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0019.wav|When Oswald was apprehended, a bus transfer marked for the Lakewood-Marsalis route was found in his shirt pocket.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0020.wav|"The transfer was dated ""Friday November 22, '63"" and was punched in two places by the bus driver."|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0021.wav|On the basis of this punchmark, which was distinctive to each Dallas driver,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0022.wav|the transfer was conclusively identified as having been issued by Cecil J. McWatters, a busdriver for the Dallas Transit Co.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0023.wav|On the basis of the date and time on the transfer, McWatters was able to testify that the transfer had been issued by him|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0024.wav|on a trip which passed a check point at St. Paul and Elm Streets at 12:36 p.m., November 22, 1963.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0025.wav|McWatters was sure that he left the checkpoint on time|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0026.wav|and he estimated that it took him 3 to 4 minutes to drive three blocks west from the checkpoint to Field Street,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0027.wav|which he reached at about 12:40 p.m.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0028.wav|McWatters' recollection is that he issued this transfer to a man who entered his bus just beyond Field Street,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0029.wav|where a man beat on the front door of the bus, boarded it and paid his fare.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0030.wav|About two blocks later, a woman asked to get off to make a 1 o'clock train at Union Station|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0036.wav|At about 6:30 p.m. on the day of the assassination, McWatters viewed four men in a police lineup.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0038.wav|and who, during the ride south on Marsalis, had an argument with a woman passenger.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0039.wav|In his Commission testimony, McWatters said he had been in error and that a teenager named Milton Jones was the passenger he had in mind.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0040.wav|In a later interview, Jones confirmed that he had exchanged words with a woman passenger on the bus during the ride south on Marsalis.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0041.wav|McWatters also remembered that a man received a transfer at Lamar and Elm Streets and that a man in the lineup was about the size of this man.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0042.wav|However, McWatters' recollection alone was too vague to be a basis for placing Oswald on the bus.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0043.wav|Riding on the bus was an elderly woman, Mary Bledsoe, who confirmed the mute evidence of the transfer.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0044.wav|Oswald had rented a room from Mrs. Bledsoe about 6 weeks before, on October 7, but she had asked him to leave at the end of a week.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0107.wav|because he was bawling out the policeman, telling them it wasn't right to put him in line with these teenagers and all of that|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ036-0108.wav|and they asked me which one and I told them. It was him all right, the same man. He showed no respect for the policemen,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0040.wav|She saw the man come to the right window of the police car. As he talked, he leaned on the ledge of the right window with his arms.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0041.wav|The man appeared to step back as the policeman, quote, calmly opened the car door, end quote, and very slowly got out and walked toward the front of the car.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0059.wav|as the man she saw kill Officer Tippit. In evaluating Mrs. Markham's identification of Oswald, the Commission considered certain allegations|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0060.wav|That Mrs. Markham described the man who killed Patrolman Tippit as, quote, short, a little on the heavy side, end quote.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0063.wav|A review of the complete transcript has satisfied the Commission|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0064.wav|that Mrs. Markham strongly reaffirmed her positive identification of Oswald and denied having described the killer|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0065.wav|as short, stocky and having bushy hair. She stated that the man weighed about 150 pounds.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0066.wav|Although she used the words, quote, a little bit bushy, end quote, to describe the gunman's hair,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0067.wav|the transcript establishes that she was referring to the uncombed state of his hair, a description fully supported by a photograph of Oswald|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0068.wav|taken at the time of his arrest.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0069.wav|Although in the phone conversation she described the man as, quote, short, end quote, on November 22nd,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0070.wav|within minutes of the shooting and before the lineup, Mrs. Markham described the man to the police as 5 foot 8 inches tall.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0071.wav|During her testimony Mrs. Markham initially denied that she ever had the above phone conversation.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0072.wav|She has subsequently admitted the existence of the conversation and offered an explanation for her denial.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0074.wav|and her positive identification of Oswald at a police lineup, the Commission considers her testimony reliable.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0075.wav|However, even in the absence of Mrs. Markham's testimony, there is ample evidence to identify Oswald as the killer of Tippit.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0084.wav|Barbara Jeanette Davis testified that no one had shown her a picture of Oswald before the identification and that she had not seen him on television.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0085.wav|She was not sure whether she had seen his picture in a newspaper on the afternoon or evening of November 22 prior to the lineup.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0086.wav|Her reaction when she saw Oswald in the lineup was that, quote,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0088.wav|Similarly, Virginia Davis had not been shown pictures of anyone prior to the lineup and had not seen either television or the newspapers during the afternoon.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0089.wav|She identified Oswald, who was the No. 2 man in the lineup, as the man she saw running with the gun:|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0091.wav|Barbara Jeanette Davis and Virginia Davis were sitting alongside each other when they made their positive identifications of Oswald.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0092.wav|Each woman whispered Oswald's number to the detective. Each testified that she was the first to make the identification.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0096.wav|Several days later he reported what he had seen and was questioned by FBI agents.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0097.wav|Smith subsequently told a Commission staff member|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0098.wav|that he saw Oswald on television the night of the murder and thought that Oswald was the man he had seen running away from the shooting.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0099.wav|On television Oswald's hair looked blond, whereas Smith remembered that the man who ran away had hair that was brown or brownish black.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0100.wav|Later, the FBI showed Smith a picture of Oswald. In the picture the hair was brown.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0101.wav|According to his testimony, Smith told the FBI, quote, It looked more like him than it did on television, end quote,|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0105.wav|They heard the sound of shots to the north of their lot. Callaway heard five shots, and Guinyard three.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0106.wav|Both ran to the sidewalk on the east side of Patton at a point about a half a block south of 10th.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0107.wav|They saw a man coming south on Patton with a revolver held high in his right hand. According to Callaway, the man crossed to the west side of Patton.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0108.wav|From across the street Callaway yelled, quote, Hey, man, what the hell is going on? End quote.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0109.wav|He slowed down, halted, said something, and then kept on going to the corner, turned right, and continued west on Jefferson.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0110.wav|Guinyard claimed that the man ran down the east side of Patton and passed within 10 feet of him before crossing to the other side.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ037-0111.wav|Guinyard and Callaway ran to 10th and Patton and found Tippit lying in the street beside his car.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0086.wav|During the evening of November 22, the Dallas Police Department performed paraffin tests on Oswald's hands and right cheek|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0087.wav|in an apparent effort to determine, by means of a scientific test, whether Oswald had recently fired a weapon.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0088.wav|The results were positive for the hands and negative for the right cheek.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0089.wav|Expert testimony before the Commission|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0090.wav|was to the effect that the paraffin test was unreliable in determining whether or not a person has fired a rifle or revolver.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0091.wav|The Commission has, therefore, placed no reliance on the paraffin tests administered by the Dallas police.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0092.wav|Oswald provided little information during his questioning.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0093.wav|Frequently, however, he was confronted with evidence which he could not explain, and he resorted to statements which are known to be lies.|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0094.wav|While Oswald's untrue statements during interrogation were not considered items of positive proof|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0095.wav|by the Commission, they had probative value in deciding the weight to be given to his denials that he assassinated President Kennedy|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0096.wav|and killed Patrolman Tippit. Since independent evidence revealed that Oswald repeatedly and blatantly lied to the police,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0097.wav|the Commission gave little weight to his denials of guilt.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0099.wav|From the outset, Oswald denied owning a rifle.|xxx|1

/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0107.wav|According to Fritz, Oswald sneered, saying that they were fake photographs, that he had been photographed a number of times the day before by the police,|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0108.wav|that they had superimposed upon the photographs a rifle and a revolver. He told Fritz a number of times that the smaller photograph|xxx|1
/content/drive/My Drive/GP/dataset/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0109.wav|was either made from the larger, or the larger photograph was made from the smaller and that at the proper time he would show that the pictures were fakes.|xxx|1
